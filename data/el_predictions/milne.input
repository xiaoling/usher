Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem calling to set up an appointment with the Interior Ministry to apply for an Israeli citizenship will discover the next available interview date is only in April. In the months leading up to the upcoming Annapolis peace conference talk of a future division of the city has prompted a staggering increase in nationalization requests by Palestinians seeking to escape life under the Palestinian Authority.

New York's top court has rejected a Christian legal group's challenge to some government benefits provided to legally married same-sex couples living in New York. The court avoided declaring that same-sex couples are entitled to all the rights of other married couples in the ruling released Thursday. New York doesn't allow same-sex marriage, so the ruling applies to couples married elsewhere. The case was pushed by the Alliance Defense Fund of Scottsdale, Ariz. In a written opinion, Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick warns the effect of the decision will be to allow an unworkable pattern of conflicting orders by public officials involving different benefits and rights.

We've been to Jura at last - we just got back - and walked from the end of the road at Ardlussa along the rough track to Barnhill. No one was in when I knocked on the door. But the seals and the deer and the peewits and the wild geese were all there. So were a hen harrier and an adder.
Excerpt: President George W Bush tried to make a quick exit from a news conference in Beijing on Sunday - only to find himself thwarted by locked doors. The president strode away from reporters looking annoyed after one said he appeared "off his game". President Bush tugged at both handles on the double doors before admitting: "I was trying to escape. Obviously, it didn't work."
Hi All, On Saturday, April 30th. Hannah and I, maybe Hany, will be going to a kid/family band called Orange Sherbert. Our friend and music teacher Jill is in the band. I haven't been to any of their performances before, but we have the CD's and love them. The concert is in Berkeley at La Pena (3105 Shattuck) at 10:30am. The cost is $4/adult and $3/kid. We would love company if anyone else is interested in going.
Never get tired of the Santa scene from Jarhead! I love playing six degrees of seperation with Jake and Reese: Reese is friends with Kate, I think Kate and Sam have a place in Brentwood next to Reese.
It makes me sad to see Jake so sad, just when I thougt I was doing ok. There are also photos of Jake on IHJ in Brentwood, still looking sombre as you'd expect.
First up was Cafe Montana on Montana Avenue, a very lovely street which finishes at the Pacific Ocean, just to the south west of Brentwood. I was particularly mesmerised by The Wagging Tail dog store, which seemed to be selling some kind of outfits for paparazzi dogs. Cafe Montana was very empty and seemed more like a restaurant, so it didn't seem like a good place for 10am, although the reviews of this cafe indicate it's a good choice for those hungrier times of the day.
Later on it was the Phillipe Stark-designed Katsuya in Brentwood.

Here is some adventure for you! My husband and I were on the "Hamster Wheel". We both had our own businesses in CA. We had a house, a dog and two kids. We worked very hard. When the real estate took a dive, people started cutting back and staying home..we saw what was comming. We decided to make a bold move. Our friends and family thought we were crazy. We sold almost everything we owned and bought a fifth wheel. We have traveled accross the United States and we are currently in Texas. We love this frugal living. Someday we will buy some land but in the meantime we are traveling and working and saving for our next trip. The great thing about a 5th wheel is there are a lot of places you can stay for free. Rent is so cheap. I wish I would have done this when I was in my 20's instead of trying to impress my friends.:) None of that matters now. I know who my real friends are. I hope you get to fulfill your dream!! www.rickbrenjessicajason.blogspot.com
They love causing a stir wherever they go, and yesterday (October 2) Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag did just that as they shopped on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, CA.

A distant cousin is going to get married on May 2019 and we can only wish her happiness. With only few more months to get all the preparations to be done she and her husband to be frequently went online to look for a place where they can have their honeymoon. It was perfect when they found this romantic cancun vacation offered by Karisma Hotels. I reckon with all the amenities and great packages that they are offering, I see no reason why they will not fall in love with the place in Cancun and the discounts that can get as well.
Now the rules forbade all religious instruction, or any sort of instruction in this Refuge, since the Chinese men who contributed to its support were opposed to women being taught anything. But the Matron had threatened to leave if she could not teach and train the girls. So she was allowed, out of her own slender salary, to hire a teacher on her own account, and this she did. The good Christian man whom she had hired came and told her he had learned that Ah Moi was a good girl, and was from a Mission School in Canton, and finally he brought the girl's own mother, who testified that this was true. We have not space to go into this story in detail, but we later visited the school at Canton from which the girl had been brought, talked with the teachers who had had her under their care for years, and it was literally true,--that she was a perfectly pure girl (and how could she have been suffering from such a disease?), who had been entrapped for such a dreadful fate. She would have been put into a life of shame by the Inspector, never to have escaped her terrible servitude, probably, but for the energetic efforts of this Chinese Christian man and the Refuge Matron, who rescued her from the Protectorate and its wicked business of assigning girls to brothels. And here sat the Inspector, telling
of October, 1877, nearly a year later, she engaged a single room for herself and a servant[A] at 42 Peel street, of a woman named Lau-a Yee. Mrs. Lau, the landlady, had the top floor of a little house. Another family had the first floor, and the street door leading up to Mrs. Lau's apartments ended in a trap door which was shut down at night. There were also folding doors half way up the stairway, not reaching to the ceiling, however, that could be locked at night to make the place doubly secure from intruders. The little upper flat consisted of only three rooms. Mrs. Lau occupied the front room, and her servant woman slept on the floor in the passage-way, and took care of Mrs. Lau's little child. This servant woman had a friend come over from Canton to spend the night with her and seek for employment. The middle room was occupied by Tai Yau, the woman who had sold her little boy into slavery, and her servant. The back room was vacant. Tai Yau was about twenty-six years old, and her servant nearly sixty.
On May 30th, 1879, Sir John Smale, Chief Justice of the Colony of Hong Kong, wrote a letter for the information of the Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, to the effect that he had sentenced, on the previous day, two poor women to imprisonment with hard labor, for detaining a boy 13 years old. The women sold the little boy to a druggist for $17.50. The relatives traced their lost boy, came from Canton and claimed him, but the druggist refused to give him up, producing a bill of sale, and the boy was not given up until they appeared in the police court. The Chief Justice adds:

People ... this tour is amazing. I stayed away from any descriptions of how things go down on this tour and I'm glad that I kept it a surprise. The Pip character opened the show and she looked HOT in her rubber leggings and black hair. Her performance was spirited ... especially The Waitress. I was able to snap a few more shots from my seat which I will post below ... along with a short clip of Tori performing Big Wheel . I will be seeing Tori Amos again 4 more times on this tour (Detroit, Cleveland, Anaheim and LA) with my BFF Sarah (who I missed last night) and I'm so excited for what's to come!!! More deets from last night's show below. [ Source ]
Drew Carey, come on down! The comedian will replace Bob Barker as the new host of The Price Is Right. The Cleveland native confirmed his new gig as the host of the CBS game show during a taping of the The Late Show with David Letterman, which is set to air Monday. Barker retired last month after 35 years of hosting the daytime sensation, drawing a slew of replacement contenders including Rosie O'Donnell, Ian Ziering, George Hamilton and Mario Lopez. Carey, who will also be host of a new CBS prime-time game show, The Power of 10, told Letterman that he only learned that the deal had been done a few minutes before appearing on stage. Yeah, I am not at all in agreement on this decision. My pick was for George Hamilton to get the job. I just know that watching The Price is Right with Drew Carey as the host will be about as exciting as watching The Family Feud with any of the many lame-ass hosts who followed Richard Dawson as host. This whole matter can be summed up in two words: Poop Sandwich . [ Source ]

Jake is in Columbia filming a new movie with Jessica Biel at the Capitol Building, which is a few blocks away. I guess he needed a gym to keep in shape at, and we just happened to be in the right place at the right time! I wish I had a picture to show how hot and muscular he was.
Her family has a house in Charleston which is only a one and a half hour drive away from Columbia.
Back to Jake... A poster on IMDb seems to indicate that next week filming on Nailed is moving back to the Statehouse in Columbia so more sightings will hopefully follow.
Born in Constantinople, c. 734; died on March 19, 813. Saint Plato was younger than 13 when his parents were killed by a plague afflicting Constantinople. At that time, his uncle, the high treasurer of the empire, took over his education and Plato acted as his apprentice. He was accomplished at taking down business affairs in shorthand, yet even more advanced in affairs of the spirit. Because of his high birth, virtue, and skill, he came to be regarded as a prize catch for those seeking a husband for their daughters. Plato, however, was more attracted to prayer and seclusion than marriage. He convinced his three brothers to devote themselves to God, and live in a state of celibacy. Then, seeking to free himself from worldly attachments, he freed all his slaves and sold his large estates. Before retiring to Symboleon on Mount Olympus, Bithynia, he used some of the money to obtain spouses for his two sisters-who became the mothers of saints-and distributed the rest among the poor.
To the northeast of Arabia lay the large Neo-Persian Empire of the Sassanids; to the northwest lay the Byzantine, or Eastern Roman Empire, centered in Constantinople. Numerically, the Arabs were no match for their opponents. On the field of battle, though, the inspired Arabs rapidly conquered all of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. By 642, Egypt had been wrested from the Byzantine Empire, while the Persian armies had been crushed at the key battles of Qadisiya in 637, and Nehavend in 642.

At age 14, Kerli represented Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest and was signed in the U.S. by L.A. Reid shortly after. "Working with noted producer/mixer/songwriter David Maurice, whose credits include Garbage and JC Chasez, Kerli wrote the personal lyrics to all the songs, reflecting her amazing odyssey from a small town in Estonia across the sea from Scandanavia to major label recording artist."

Halle Berry wants at least one baby ; Holly Hunter gives birth to 2 . I am so excited for tonight ... Imogen Heap is playing a show at the Magic Bag in Ferndale! I haven't seen Imogen live in years! The last time I saw her she was touring in support of her first album iMegaphone opening for Rufus Wainwright (I think we saw her and Rufus about 6 times on that tour). Frou Frou (her side project) never toured ... at least, they never came anywhere near Detroit. Then, last summer Imogen was scheduled to be the opening act for Tori Amos ' Summer of Sin tour ... and then she had to cancel because her record company wouldn't pay for her tour. BUT FINALLY ... she's touring again ... and I'm seeing her tonight:

It is my sad duty to report that the incomparable Godfather of Soul , James Brown , has died this morning after being hospitalized in Atlanta, GA for pneumonia over the weekend . Word came out yesterday that the ailing singer had contracted a bout of pneumonia and was hospitalized yesterday and very sadly passed on today -- he was 73:
The album is currently the #1 album of 2007 having sold over 2,6 million copies. Daughtry's latest single 'Home' was released April 10, 2007. The band's tour continues this evening in Atlanta, GA.

I am delighted to announce that following yesterday's discovery of the Moonlight Mile post office, BBMISwear did indeed throw herself head first through the hatch.

Britney and Sean Preston Spears are spending some time vacationing in Hawaii ... and that bathing suit isn't really doing her any favors at all!
Leaving his office of nearly 20 years gives him more time to campaign but immediately opens the door for criticism. U.S. Sen. Dan Inouye was first to rebuke Abercrombie, saying Hawaii was losing valuable political clout. "It leaves us a vote shy in the House at a time when major policy changes like health care reform, a war spending measure, the Akaka Bill and others are shaping up for debate and passage," Inouye said in an e-mail. Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann, Abercrombie's expected opponent in the 2010 Democratic primary, agreed. "He is leaving the state in a lurch. He has become a very influential member of Congress. I think he put a lot of people in a difficult situation, including the city," Hannemann said yesterday during an interview.
I get a little bit annoyed when I read people make comments - almost snobbishly - that they never travel outside the US because it is too costly. "Oh, we are so passionate about saving money that we would never dare set foot outside of this country because it is soooo expensive", they say while boarding a flight to Honolulu.

Once a placid tourist attraction only a few hours from the capital, Islamabad, the town's capture shows how Islamist militants have penetrated deep into Pakistan from their strongholds on the remote Afghan frontier.
KABUL, Afghanistan â To many in the Afghan capital, thereâs an obvious explanation for the dramatic re-emergence of the Taliban â a force that seemed thoroughly dust-binned after the arrival of the worldâs most powerful army seven years ago. "Now," as one 23-year-old Kabul shopkeeper, Qand Mohmadi, put it, "we think America is supporting both the Taliban and the Afghan government. Thatâs what everyone says."
The stars of Grey's Anatomy and Pirates of the Caribbean were among the fan favorites at the 34th annual People's Choice Awards on Tuesday, as CBS scrapped its usual live broadcast of the show in favor of a strike-friendly, pre-taped program. The two-month-old Writers Guild of America strike has taken a toll on Hollywood's awards season, leading to the cancellation of the Golden Globes and the scaling-down of People's Choice. The fate of other shows, including the Oscars, remains in question. The People's Choice Awards announced last month that it would replace its traditional live show with "a new format" that had its crews deliver trophies to music, film and television stars on location. Robin Williams accepted his award for favorite funny male while on tour with the United Service Organizations in Kabul, Afghanistan. Members of Rascal Flatts picked up their prize for favorite group at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, and Patrick Dempsey found out he was the favorite male TV star while at the Daytona International Speedway in Orlando. The show couldn't be canceled entirely, host Queen Latifah said Monday. "The thing about the People's Choice Awards that's different from everybody else is it's the people's choice," she said. "So as much as we actors and writers and everyone are dealing with the writers strike and supporting the Writers Guild, you can't disrespect the people who keep us working, and that's the people. Ten million people logged on and voted for everyone, so out of respect for them, we have to" present the awards.
Marefat High School is supported entirely by the poor of Daste Bachi and Jabarhan. It is governed by a board of trustees elected by the parents, the teachers and the students. Last year, the school was attacked by a mob incited by Tehran's mullah in Kabul, Ayatollah Mohseni, from his gleaming, blue-domed madrassah down in Karte Se. The mob came screaming for Aziz Royesh, Marefat's short and stocky principal. The school is a dirty nest of Christians, communists and prostitutes, they shouted, there are boys and girls together, Royesh is an apostate, Royesh must die.

"I've spoken at great length to the Red Cross - I believe I'm the only Canadian journalist who has - in Kabul, with someone who has had a lot to do with this file. He said the Red Cross has no issues with Canada, or any other country for that matter, at this time.

On the surface, an unremarkable detail amid the devastation in Kashmir. But this is a story worth pausing over. For between the lines, it speaks volumes about the real stakes in the war between the civilized world and radical Islam.
This week's winner (not a crime, but related to the murder of Dr. George Tiller.) Kentucky : Pastor Ken Pagano will host an "Open Carry Church Service" on June 27th in which congregants are encouraged to bring their firearms to the New Bethel Church. Pagano is adverising his service with a poster using a "blood splatter" font. One lucky disciple of Jesus will win a free handgun at the service. Pagano: "Not every branch of Christianity is pacifistic." NO KIDDING.
The press has been quick to report on lower-than-average Great Lakes levels over the last decade. Many of the articles quote environmental and other groups predicting the dire consequences of global warming's influence. "Warming saps Great Lakes: Water levels could take big drop as Earth gets hotter" is the headline of an article that appeared April 7, 2007, in The Detroit News. In the article, Scudder Mackey of Canada's University of Windsor predicts that in a worst case scenario, Lake St. Clair's shoreline could recede by as much as 3.5 miles. In the same article George Kling, a University of Michigan ecologist, suggests that within 30 years summers in Michigan are likely to feel more like those in Kentucky today and that by the end of the century, summer weather will resemble Arkansas and northern Mississippi.
Conan O'Brien did a pretty good job playing host for the 2006 Emmy Awards , even if he inadvertently offended a whole bunch of people by performing a skit about a disastrous airplane crash on the very day that a real airplane crash occurred in Kentucky (head on over to Jossip.com to watch the Conan video if you missed watching it live last night). Overall, tho, last night really wasn't about Conan or his performance as host ... for me, it was really all about how 24 rules the effing world !!!
"We have gay Republicans starting chapters in South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Cincinnati, Oklahoma, all over the heartland," said Christopher Barron, political director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay-rights group.

Skiing in Europe sucks this year due to climate change or whatever you want to call it. It's being called a "snow crisis" . That may be good news for the American skiing industry. Kenya's Mt Kilimanjaro hasn't much snow, so don't think you can go there either. Come on over Europeans- the dollar is cheap and there's still snow in our mountains somewhere. Spend spend spend.

Hi Peeps, Kind of new to scene but hoping to make some friendly and business connections. Husband and I moved here (near Nederland) from SF a couple of years ago and this winter, I decided to go back to teaching and offering a guide service to Summit/Eagle resorts. I have a long history of teaching sports to the LGBT community, including soccer, tennis and now skiing. Previous winters were spent as a patroller at Alpine Meadows at Lake Tahoe, but I decided to try teaching instead of patrolling this year. I have been getting some pretty good responses and have had happy clients so far. I have several ads on Craigslist and if you want to check one out go to Denver CL and tap in gay ski instrutor under services- lessons.
Athans, 46, was not arrested or charged, but agreed to fully cooperate with police in their investigation of Internet-based prostitution at hotels in the city, according to the report. Athans was pulled over by police on I-75 minutes after leaving the Residence Inn on Livernois, just east of I-75 and south of Big Beaver, the evening of Feb. 26. He was driving a Cadillac DeVille registered jointly to him and Stabenow at their address in Lansing.

No, not for gas; for water. The Chicago Tribune's headline reads: Tensions rise as drought worsens, threatens to spread North and South Carolina are fighting over a river. In Tennessee, springs are drying up, jeopardizing production of Jack Daniels whiskey. The mayor of Los Angeles is asking residents to take shorter showers. And in Georgia, the governor is praying for rain. More than a third of the United States is in the grip of a menacing drought that threatens to spread before the summer ends. While much of the West has experienced drought conditions for close to a decade, the latest system is centered over Alabama and extends to much of the Southeast, heavily affecting Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, North and South Carolina and Virginia as well as parts of Arkansas and West Virginia.
Louisiana has a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and prevents the state from recognizing any legal status for common-law relationships, domestic partnerships or civil unions. Mississippi and Alabama both have defense of marriage acts which also deny rights to gay and lesbian couples.
Language creating the option was added Thursday to a bill on common law marriage. The House gave the bill first-round approval. Proponents say the option would strengthen marriages in Kansas. Couples choosing covenant marriage would have to receive premarital counseling and sign an affidavit stating their intentions. Opponents say the law would force couples to stay in relationships that may be harmful. Arkansas, Arizona and Louisiana already have covenant marriage laws.
Photo credit: Splash News Kevin Federline visited his estranged wife, Britney Spears, in rehab on Friday, PEOPLE has learned. Spears, 25, is currently being treated at Promises in Malibu. A source familiar with the situation says Federline, 28, has been involved in her stay there. "He cares a lot about her," the source said. Federline stopped by the facility on Friday and stayed about an hour and a half. On Thursday, Spears's father, Jamie Spears, 54, told FOX News from his home in Louisiana that his daughter is "a sick little girl. ... We're just trying to take care of her." He added that his daughter's problems are "not about what other people think" and that he and Spears's mom, Lynne, are "concerned about our daughter." However, reports that Spears is on "suicide watch" are false, her manager Larry Rudolph told Extra on Friday. "The story is absolutely untrue. She is in rehab, and it is very disappointing that various media outlets are running these false stories about her, as Britney tries to get better," Rudolph said ... "Britney scared everyone pretty bad. Kevin is worried that's for sure," a source close to Federline tells PEOPLE. "Kevin just wants her to be OK. He loves her, so however she can get better is just what we'll have to accept. [They] will make it work with the kids â it's all still for them." I am convinced we still don't know the whole story here ... that her father is hinting at some "other reason" for her break-down seems suspicious. And who would've thought that after all of this divorce drama and now rehab drama that K-Fed would be the one to come out of it smelling like a rose. It's strange to see him playing the role of concerned hubby and caring father but I suppose when someone goes as crazy as Britney Spears has then anything this possible. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Spederline ended up getting back together after all of this -- after all, who else but K-Fed could put up with her insanity? [ Source ]
Shortly thereafter, the Republican Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, stepped out from behind his state flag to give a possible rebuttal. He seemed rather stiff and wooden, and he ... well, here's a transcript of his speech below, with some comments from me in boldface. Judge what he had to say on its own merits:

If she doesn't have a particular district in mind, my best advice would be to expand her search a little. If she wants to stay in the DC area, she might branch out into some of the suburban MD schools. Or maybe a charter school in Washington, DC. It's best to be getting experience, in any way possible.

Asked whether the memo was likely to prevent lawsuits, Davidson said: "I guess we'll just have to see whether it is successful or not." The statement said that "early and unnecessary" court losses over marriage rights in Arizona and Indiana "hurt our other cases." Courts in New York, Washington state and Maryland narrowly rejected same-sex marriage and adopted some of the "contorted reasoning" from those decisions, the memo said.

As an aside, according to Watchdogblog, Massachusetts was also vilified for being "Taxachusetts" by the "values" voters. In fact, "Massachusetts has a combined state and local rate of 5.6%, ranking it the 34th highest out of the 50 states. For comparison: Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Idaho, and New Mexico are among those with higher rates." (NY should be in there too with high tax states)

Moments after a little boy who was believed to be in his parents' homemade helium balloon was found safe and sound, millions of Americans came to the realization that they had flushed the entire fucking afternoon down the fucking toilet. "I watched the entire drama unfold and then it turned out that no drama had unfolded," said Carol Foyler, 32, of Missoula, Montana. "I can't tell you how pissed I am at that fucking kid." At their Colorado home, the parents of six-year-old Falcon Heene said that they were relieved that their son was all right and that they were pushing forward with their plans to build a giant child-operated flame-throwing robot.

It appears that filming in New Mexico for Brothers is continuing still, at least for the Tobey Maguire element of the movie. Pictures were posted today of one lucky NM local dressed in full garb as a member of the Taliban. He has just completed two days of filming for Brothers. Jake, of course, does not appear to be in New Mexico at the moment but this may just mean that the emphasis is currently on the Afghanistan element of the movie, which, one (meaning me) could naively assume may take more preparation and extra days.
Indeed, it is difficult to identify any race in which the Republican candidate currently has the momentum. Alaska is perhaps the only state where the Presidential coattails clearly are liable to help them, but with a verdict still forthcoming in Ted Stevens' corruption trial, they have to dodge a bullet that has the potential to ruin their chances of retaining the seat. Meanwhile, the Republicans are being out-campaigned in North Carolina, suffering under the weight of the economy in states like Georgia and Kentucky , and are having difficulty mounting any offense in states like New Mexico where Barack Obama is strong. Even in Minnesota, where Al Franken's campaign has had many false starts, it's now Norm Coleman who is on the defensive .

In 2008 a wedding photographer in New Mexico was fined under the state's sexual orientation discrimination laws for refusing to accept a same-sex couple as clients. The case has been used by the Christianists in virtually every battle for LGBT rights as a glaring example of "homofascists" using newly-won rights to throttle people of faith. Today the anti-gay Alliance Defense Fund announced that they are launching an appeal of the photographer's conviction.
Therefore, we should keep in mind that California, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Texas were all part of New Spain for hundreds of years, before their relatively brief period as part of the newly independent Mexico , and then it was decades longer still before the Stars and Stripes flew over any of their capitals.
These critics, such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State, argue that Sunday's sermons at churches in Oregon, Texas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and other states will violate federal tax law by politicizing the pulpit. That, they believe, will undercut the independence churches have long enjoyed to speak out about moral and ethical issues in American life, including women's suffrage, child labor and civil rights.
I have a slight rant, what on earth is a 'quasi-british accent' - firstly, the vast majority of the cast is British, so any accent is hardly 'quasi' - and I've no idea what a 'British' accent is - I live in London and don't speak anything like someone from Newcastle/Liverpool/Manchester/Glasgow/Belfast/Cardiff etc - the 'British' accent varies hugely, even from cities right next to each other, e.g. Liverpudlians speak differently to people from Manchester - Mancunians tend to have much flatter vowels and a slower talking speed, I presume the reviewer means a Standard Home Counties accent (think Gwennie in Sliding Doors)*gets down off high horse*
Valerie Plame didn't send her husband Joseph Wilson to Niger. The CIA did. Because they didn't want bogus information that the public would think came from them to start a war. But it is reported that Ms. Plame sent Mr. Wilson. This translates into overbearing wife of henpecked husband sending him out for a carton of milk and the dry cleaning.

The Democrats are now favored to take over eight seats from the Republicans: Virginia , New Mexico, New Hampshire, Colorado, Alaska, North Carolina, Oregon, and Minnesota. If the Democrats win all eight of those races, they will only need one more to achieve 60 seats, and they have good opportunities in Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky.
There was a certain ex-candidate (not from season six, but who does have her own message board) who I would be was VERY disappointed to say the least when Appalachian State beat Michigan (because Michigan is her alma mater) and again the following week when they lost to Oregon (if you have followed the show from the earlier seasons, you might be able to figure out which candidate I'm refering to).

It seems the successes are coming faster and faster!
In three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, the states and groups sought an immediate court order preventing the regulation from going into effect Tuesday and a permanent decision voiding the rule.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ruled that a debtor may not reduce the number of votes required to confirm a chapter 11 plan of reorganization by purchasing certain claims. Such vote "gerrymandering" resulted in an unconfirmable plan, the court ruled. In re Machne Menachem, Inc., 233 Fed. Appex. 119, 2007 WL 1157015 (3d Cir. Apr. 19, 2007 (Pa.)).Machne Menachem was a nonprofit company that operated a summer camp in Pike County, Pa. In 2001, amid a battle for control among its board of directors, the company filed a petition for bankruptcy. Machne submitted a plan for reorganization, as did one of its former directors, Yaakov Spritzer. Following the voting, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the debtorâs plan over Spritzerâs objection.Spritzer argued that confirmation of the debtorâs plan had been secured in bad faith. He argued that Levi Heber, the son of a director of the debtor, had purchased the claims of four unsecured creditors. This purchase allegedly was arranged by the debtor, which then was able to move the purchased claims from "Class Four" (which contained non-insider, unsecured claims), to "Class Five" (which contained insider, unsecured claims).The bankruptcy court determined that the mere fact that the debtor purchased a creditorâs interest for the purpose of securing approval of the plan did not amount to bad faith. However, on appeal, the district court relied on case law suggesting that the purchase of claims by a debtor or insider can be an indication of bad faith, and ruled that the purchase of the claims and their reassignment to another class resulted in an unconfirmable plan. The Bankruptcy Code requires a debtorâs plan to be approved by at least one impaired class of creditors, the court noted. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1129(a)(10). In the case at hand, the only such class was Class Four, which had approved the debtorâs plan by a vote of seven claims to four. The four claims purchased by Heber could have altered the outcome, the district court noted. The purchase of claims outside the plan allowed the debtor to reclassify them to reduce the number of votes required for confirmation, the court determined. Hence, the purchase and reclassification of claims effectively "gerrymandered" Class Four to secure confirmation, the district court concluded. The Third Circuit agreed. "As weâve previously stated, vote manipulation by the gerrymandering of classes âseriously underminesâ the âcritical confirmation requirements set out in Section 1129(a)(8) (acceptance by all impaired classes) and Section 1129 (a)(10) (acceptance by at least one impaired class in the event of a âcram downâ)," the court stated, citing precedent. Further, the debtor provided "scant support for rebutting the conclusion that its plan was confirmed by impermissible gerrymandering of classes." In addition, the Third Circuit noted that the district court had found that the payment of creditors outside of the plan or reorganization violated the Bankruptcy Code provision requiring "the same treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class." 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1123 (a)(4). "We agree â¦ that the debtorâs orchestration of the purchase of claims outside the plan of reorganization undermined the critical confirmation requirements of the bankruptcy code," the Third Circuit concluded. http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=57978

Can't all the major Left Wing Progressive Blogs ignore the ravings of the Right for even ONE FREAKING WEEK? Liz "I know all about everything since my daddy's king" Cheney was on Fox again spewing bull. George Will, Eric Cantor and Cheney appear more regularly than the Pa. Groundhog. Sunday talk shows have Howard Morris Agents booking Neos, teabaggers and the usual cadre of Right Wing nuts into 2011! We listen to the incessant blatherings of Limbaugh, the drooling insanities of Beck and other idiots from the right. No sooner do they puke idiocy than the Left can't get it into print fast enough. No Democrats appear (they have no balls or intellect) and if they do, the Right Wing Media IGNORES THEM! So the fools on the right don't hear anything about what Democrats want to do anyway (if the Left even wants to do anything). But since nearly every Leftist Blog regurgitates the vile spewed from those on the far right, millions more hear that propagandistic tripe than could possibly ever get it from FOX. The Left MUST stop giving a free pass to those on the right through the internet. More people follow left wing blogs than the right. More independents follow left wing blogs and all they get is the Himmlerian Propaganda these fools spout. And make no mistake about it, the mouthpiece of the Republicans, Luntz, knows this. That's why he gets the goose-stepping Right to mindlessly repeat his babbling. He knows his message will reach more Americans because the Left repeats it to a bigger audience than FOX. Try it for a week. Quit bitching about what the crazies on the right are saying. Don't give them exposure. leave that to FOX. Who are we competing with, CNN? What are we becoming, the media we all despise?
The newspaper in the Pa town Senator Clinton identifies with for its Rodham family roots --Scranton --endorsed Obama.
Israel-Palestine: The Cancer" was a nasty piece of work, replete with lies, slanders and myths about "the chosen people," "the Jenin massacre," describing the Jews as "a contemptuous people taking satisfaction in humiliating others," "imposing their unmerciful rule," and so on.
But the truth is that a savage, terrible and appallingly bloodthirsty insurgency is under way in southern Thailand. It is the third great insurgency in the world today, after Iraq and Afghanistan. More people are dying in horrific violence in southern Thailand than in Palestine or the southern Philippines, or in the ethnic strife in some of the outlying islands of Indonesia.
Second, if the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine are at the core of the radicalization, why are there virtually no Afghans, Iraqis or Palestinians among the terrorists? Rather, the bombers are mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, Egypt and Pakistan - or they are Western-born converts to Islam. Why would a Pakistani or a Spaniard be more angry than an Afghan about American troops in Afghanistan? It is precisely because they do not care about Afghanistan as such, but see the United States involvement there as part of a global phenomenon of cultural domination.
Taji Mustafa, a high-profile Hizb ut-Tahrir member in Britain, who makes frequent media appearances, lamented the state of the Muslim world, and slammed Muslim governments for failing to "liberate Palestine." "Why, after all these years, is Palestine still occupied? Is it because the Muslim masses do not want to liberate the land...? No. Is it because the neighboring states do not have the resources to occupy Palestine? No. It is because the rulers of the Muslim world refuse to mobilize the ummah (Islamic nation) to liberate this land. Instead, (they are) like the Saudi kingdom. Only a few days ago, Saudi Arabia decided to sit down with Israel to negotiate - the surrender process - to hand over Palestine," Mustafa said.
The boy continues with a declaration of his solidarity with "thousands of thousands of children from Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Afghanistan," whom Bush has "denied their fathers and mothers."
Third, Israel and Hamas have profoundly different aims. Israel has accepted the principle of a two-state solution as the basis for ending the conflict. Hamas, by contrast, rejects this. Its language of "resistance" or "ending occupation" (even though no Israelis, civilian or military, other than the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit, have "occupied" Gaza for the past three years) is but a veiled expression of Hamas's actual objective: destroying Israel and creating an Islamist Palestinian state in its place. Credulous observers may see more peaceful purposes, but Hamas leaders periodically reassert these objectives, whether in the Hamas covenant or, in the words of a prominent Hamas cleric, Muhsen Abu 'Ita, speaking on Al-Aqsa TV and calling for "the annihilation of the Jews here in Palestine."
"By Allah, if you do not wake up now in this Great Jihad you should hold your head in shame, another woman will be raped tonight in Chechnya and Iraq, another daughter shot in Palestine. Your mothers from Afghanistan to Palestine are dead, their children are still weeping - remove the pro-Israeli Zionist MP (Member of Parliament) who destroyed so many of their lives" -- Excerpt from a campaign leaflet circulated in Rochdale, Lancashire.
The majority of the refugees arrived in Lebanon following the creation of Israel in 1948. A second wave arrived in the 1970s after Jordan's then king Hussein kicked out the Palestine Liberation Organisation and thousands of its fighters.
Up until midweek last week, some 48 to 72 hours before Mr. McCain introduced Ms. Palin at a Friday rally in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. McCain was still holding out the hope that he could choose a good friend, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, a Republican close to the campaign said. Mr. McCain had also been interested in another favorite, former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.

Last night's 23-song set included much of their early hits like Complicated , but also leaned heavily on their just-released seventh studio album, 7 . The highlight of the show for me was their cover of Ten City's That's The Way Love Is , one of my favorite early house tracks. Poi Dog's current eight-piece ensemble has one of the highest levels of musicianship you'll likely experience live; I recommended catching them on the rest of this tour , which hits Philly, Baltimore, and Boston over the next three nights.
Sounds like Reese is at some softball camp at UCLA, a little bit more serious than the drills that she was doing. Sounds like Paul Rud and Jack are in Philly filming and that Owen and Reese are not needed on set right now, maybe next week.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOS ANGELES TRANSIT. It is integrated, comprehensive, and COSTS ONLY USD 3 PER UNLIMITED USAGE DAY PASS for BOTH bus and rail lines!!!! Muacks. Eat that, New York and Philly.
Even more crucial will be a meeting in December in Poland to start negotiations over what to do after the U.N.-backed Kyoto Protocol on climate change expires in 2012. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developing nations, such as India and China, were exempt from limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. Some rich countries, such as the U.S., which didn't join the treaty, said excluding poor countries basically added an unfair burden to rich nations while allowing poorer countries to keep polluting.
As a result, Israel's regional isolation is easing, as Islamic countries from Pakistan to Qatar to Morocco openly extend or intensify relations, while anti-Israel rejectionists such as Syria and Hezbollah are isolated and even condemned by name in the U.N. Security Council.
For a few brief moments, while gunfire echoed around Rangoon last September, world leaders sat up and took notice - just as the lethal violence in Lhasa in recent days has forced politicians partly to acknowledge the human rights nightmare of Tibet for the first time in many years. In response to the Burmese crackdown, there was outspoken criticism of a government which was (again) murdering its citizens on its streets. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, declared his abhorrence, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations expressed "revulsion", and even the UN security council, after much grinding of diplomatic teeth, agreed to "strongly deplore" the killing.
A second fire, in the former capital Rangoon, also reportedly destroyed scores of home.
Journalists and lawyers from Rangoon have also been speaking in favour of the referendum, the Taungup resident said.
Burma has banned the film, and police in Rangoon have given strict orders to shops not to sell pirated copies of the movie.
Politically, the current military regime won't soften its political stand against opposition groups. The detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will likely celebrate her 63rd birthday party on June 19 alone in custody in her home in Rangoon. Under house arrest for 12 of the past 18 years, she will continue to be recognized as the only Nobel laureate in detention.
According to business sources in Rangoon, prices have gone up by more than 13 per cent in the past week, since the beginning of a crackdown on illegal fuel trading that started on February 27.
Right now the military government is planning to have a constitutional referendum in May. In many areas in Burma, people are illegally forced as well as offered financial incentives to vote. In other area, people are threatened. Some of the activists were brutally beaten up by unknown assailants very recently. The closer the May referendum is, the more scared and concerned the people are about their safety and security. Securities have been tightened inside Rangoon. Police and security forces are deployed on the main streets of Rangoon.
There is a flood in Witney, England at the moment, and other towns with wonderful names like Reading, Henley, and Tewkesbury are under threat. It's the very worst disaster of its kind since 1947.Â Tens of thousands are without water (well, the good kind) or electricity. Streets, reeking of sewage, are strewn with debris -- wrecked goods from homes, mostly. Roads in central England have been closed, railway lines have been shut down, and stranded residents are being winched out by helicopter.
SAN DIEGO -- Shawne Merriman received no respite.
DANCE MISSION THEATER, SAN FRANCISCO
Classic San Francisco buildings reflecting the art deco style are covered in an excellent collection of photos of masterpieces reflecting the work of one man: one Timothy Pflueger, an immigrant's son who began his architectural practice after San Francisco's 1906 earthquake, and who proved one of the city's most prolific architects, producing many unique and classic art deco designs over a 40-year history. His life and works are surveyed in ART DECO SAN FRANCISCO, an oversized pairing of photos and architectural history highly recommended as a basic 'must' for both architecture and art libraries and any California history collection.
Such a debate is going on over a Sarasota elementary school. Lush Bimbo even got in on it.
Homosexuals have won acceptance at differing levels throughout post-communist Eastern Europe. The Czech Republic and Slovenia recognize same-sex partnerships, as will Hungary from July 1. Poland hasn't gone that far. It has an active gay rights movement and gay nightclubs in the cities, but the Catholic church and some conservative politicians still publicly describe homosexuality as abnormal and immoral.
The current version of a federal transportation funding bill, which could be debated by Congress this fall, requires all 50 states to mandate the devices for anyone convicted of drunken driving or risk losing federal highway money. Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia have interlock ignition laws for at least some offenders. Alabama, South Dakota and Vermont have no such laws. They are installed in about 150,000 vehicles in the USA â a number that would approach 1 million if they were required for every convicted drunken driver. Proponents of broader use of interlock systems â including MADD, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Governors Highway Safety Association â say they would save an additional 4,000-8,000 lives a year.
California's change of heart came as 10 other states, including Florida and Utah, filed a brief in support of a request by gay marriage opponents to delay the effective date of the court ruling. The offices of attorneys general of Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah protested that their states, which restrict marriage to unions of a man and a woman, would be inundated by litigation seeking to have them recognize same-sex nuptials in California.
Sam Brownback: The Senator from South Dakota will have to put up with a lot of "Brownback Mountain" jokes if he ever manages to raise his silhouette above the second tier. As to garnering the support of the GOP al Qaeda ("The Base"), it's a possibility. Rudy Giuliani: A dark horse in a loose box. Rudy's got so many people gunning for him right now that it's no longer funny; it's hilarious. Everyone from pro- and anti-abortion groups, his ex-wives, the NYPD and FDNY first responders at the WTC, and gay and anti-gay groups are all either pissed off or confused. Which can also piss them off. And Rudy's the front-runner. Mike Huckabee: I heart Huckabee (actually, I DON'T). It seems that even in his home state of Arkansas the only time he gets any real name recognition is in association with his weight loss. Came in second in the Iowa straw poll. Duncan Hunter: Racist, anti-immigration candidate from California. He might end up fighting Tancredo for his share of extreme fringe vote - you know, the ones who talk to Jesus on a two-way radio and immediately hate everyone who doesn't talk/act/look/think like they do. Alan Keyes: I used to like Alan Keyes, way back in the first Bush administration - he was an African-American GOP member who was unafraid to speak his mind about the relevant issues. Then he got snubbed, started his own talk radio show and turned into someone who is so rabid that he disowned his own daughter for being a lesbian. Besides, he's an African-American; with all the current trouble the GOP field has in making debate dates with minority groups, the Party's getting nervous. John McCain: I call McCain The Political Bisexual - willing to adopt or espouse any position so long as it'll get him votes. He recently revealed his Religious Bisexuality, by waffling between Episcopalian and Baptist until finally settling on Baptist (it suits his pandering well to appeal to a large chunk of the GOP al Qaeda in this way). I respect him still for his military service, but will I vote for him? Dream a little faster. Ron Paul: Another minor candidate in the Mike Gravel mold, Paul can say what he likes and try to shock his fellow Republicans into at least a fraction of a second of self-examination before being shouted down. Mitt Romney: I call him "Mittens" because he seems to be dominated or at least subservient to his wife. Came in first in the Iowa straw poll after spending a shitload of money to garner only 30% of the vote. Waffles almost as much as Carter did in '76. He's a businessman, apparently, which begs the question: Based on the track record of George W Bush, do we REALLY want another "CEO President?" Tom Tancredo: Another racist fringe candidate, this time from Colorado. He's all anti-immigration and inveighs against immigrants, conveniently forgetting the fact that he's Italian and his surname is of German (actually Gothic) derivation. Less said about him the better, actually. Finally, we come to the Dessicated Corpse of Fred Thompson: You know, I'm so glad that Tommy Thompson dropped out of the race so I won't get him confused for this winded gasbag. He was a spy for the Nixon Administration during the Watergate hearings, a phony on the hustings in Tennessee, a lazy 1.5-term Senator from that same state, and a one-dimensional actor. Which makes the GOP love him to pieces, as he simulates their Patron Saint, Ronald Reagan (who named names for McCarthy, shilled for GE and was a one-dimensional actor, as well as a state Governor). However, Thompson shows signs of either being his trademark lazy-ass self (intellectually as well as physically) or having creeping dementia. Or maybe his trophy wife's keeping him up past his bed time.
6. What are Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Tennessee?
Florida - A principal told a father that if his son was not at school on the Day of Silence that the boy would fail the school year. Indiana - A public school is participating in the Day of Silence against the wishes of some parents. Parents were told that it is "against the law" to cancel the program and that any absences would be unexcused that day. Iowa - A school board member told a former student that a student refusing to speak on the Day of Silence was not anymore disruptive in a school setting than a "Christian wearing a cross." Oklahoma - A high school graduate wrote to her former principal to protest the celebration of the Day of Silence. The principal said that if he did not allow the Day of Silence, he could not allow Bible clubs and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. South Dakota - A student was told that if she is absent on the Day of Silence, she must write a paper explaining why she will not participate.
"Tonight, I can stand here and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States." With those words, Barack Obama made history Tuesday night. Sixteen months after launching his brash, long-shot quest for the White House, Barack Obama claimed victory as the Democrats' standard-bearer - the first African-American candidate anointed by either major party for the White House. The backdrop chosen for Obama's declaration of victory was an in-your-face message to GOP opponent John McCain - the arena in St. Paul that will be the site of this summer's Republican National Convention. "Tonight, we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another - a journey that will bring a new and better day to America," Obama said to 17,000 cheering, joyous supporters. Another 15,000 crowded the streets outside. Obama and his wife, Michelle, who wore a violet dress, ascended the stage amid thunderous applause. Obama kissed her on the cheek before she left the stage and he began to speak. The senator thanked his family and staff but reserved his most heartfelt thanks to his grandmother, who lives in Hawaii and can't travel. "Tonight is for her," he said. The nomination prize became Obama's as scores more superdelegates rallied to his side Tuesday. His delegate share from the last two primaries in South Dakota and Montana sealed his win over Hillary Clinton. Obama's bold and successful challenge to Clinton, a former First Lady with worldwide fame and unmatched political machines, ranks with the biggest political upsets in modern American history. Obama, with his fans cheering their approval, offered generous tribute to the vanquished New York senator even as she held off from conceding defeat. "As someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning" is "an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be," Obama said.
FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- A judge has rejected an appeal by imprisoned American Indian activist Leonard Peltier, who argued the U.S. government had no right to try him for crimes that occurred on a South Dakota reservation. Peltier, 60, is serving a life sentence for killing two FBI agents during a 1975 standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. He was convicted in 1977 and has filed numerous appeals.
One of the things we'd like to do this year is drive to South Dakota, get my husband's aunt and then drive on to Callifornia and take her to see her brother, my in-laws. This trip is tempered with the very real knowledge that it could be the last time we see them. But, people are surprising, isn't 70's rather young now? I'm hoping that seeing them when they were here last, and the surprise that they do indeed get old might be making those worries far worse than they are. So, with the hope that it just seems worse, we are hoping to be able to afford this trip rather than postpone it and regret having done so.
The Oscar-winning actor is wearing the bizarre costume for his new movie Manolete, also starring Penelope Cruz. The film tells the story of one of Spain's best-known matadors, who was finally killed in the bullring by a horn to the thigh. There is something to be said for Academy Award winning actors who have no problem flaunting their pink camel toes. [ Source ]
Group C: England, USA, Algeria, Slovenia Best chance we've had in years. Expect another six months of reminders that we beat England 1-0 the first time we met in the World Cup, back in 1950. An excellent chance for Team USA to advance to the second round.
In 1978, Kiesle had pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor lewd conduct charge for tying up and molesting two boys, ages 11 and 12, at Our Lady of the Rosary in Union City. Four years later, Monsignor Vincent Breen was ousted from his position as pastor of Holy Spirit in Fremont after a police investigation revealed that he had molested at least seven girls ages 7 to 14.
Photo credit: Splash News Talk inside the company is that either it's redone, or they need to drop it - and her. When this recording session began, she'd just dumped Federline the Insect. It was not a good time in her life. To recharge her career, she reconnected with her long-ago first-time manager, the one who originally brought her to the heights, Larry Rudolph. But constant headlined misbehavior is stoking the problem. Jive fears she's alienating her fan base. Their fan base. Jive caters to a young music-buyer, and the continued atmosphere - drinking, bingeing, partying, whatevering, photos with no panties for a mother of two infants - is hitting sour notes. Besides, Jive is not in sync with the five tracks Brit delivered. Conversation in their offices is: If we bear the expense of a redo, is it possible that, down the road, because of the way she's going, we could end up with a really bad product? Or one that won't sell? The recording has stopped midway. Nothing more's been done because the company doesn't yet know what it wants to do. But that recent front page ain't helping. Meanwhile, Life & Style magazine is reporting that the Sanctuary spa that Britney retreated to after her crazy New Year's Eve night is just the first stop on her way to a real rehab center : After falling asleep (or, according to some reports, possibly passing out) at a New Year's Eve bash in Las Vegas, Britney Spears reportedly checked in to an Arizona spa for some good ol' fashioned R&R on New Year's Day. But some are wondering if a third "R" might be in the pop star's future -- could Brit be headed to rehab? According to Life & Style Weekly, who reported Brit checked into an Arizona spa called Sanctuary, the singer's parents are urging their daughter to enter therapy. "It's just been heartbreaking for her parents to watch Britney on this downward spiral," a Spears "insider" reportedly told the magazine. "It's so sad." Jive Records is refuting these reports, saying : "No rehab, and Cindy Adams' piece is inaccurate. No clue where she go her 'information.' Britney is in the middle of recording. We will have an album in 2007." Hmm ... yep, sounds like a very Britney way to kick off the new year. I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes of any of this ... I'd love to see a new album this year but I'd rather wait for quality if it would take a little longer. [ Source ]
Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz have been trying to publicly hide their love and affection but were snapped, finally, gettin' cozy and all smoochy inside the VIP area at JET nightclub at The Mirage in Vegas earlier this week:
Mary (I don't know her surname, does anyone? Does Jesus have a surname?) anyway Jesus' mother Mary, must have been made of steely stuff, Joseph (her man) wasn't that bright to start with, dragging a heavily pregnant woman to what can only be described as Vegas, Bethlehem was at its busiest time.
Since my roommate ditched me for law school, I've been frantically trying to move to a new apartment, considering that paying the rent is much less fun when my roommate's not paying half of it. I'm deciding between Venice and Beverly Hills and after agonizing over the decision, I decided I'd spend the day today pacing around both places for a few hours each to get a better feel for the areas. Unfortunately I woke up this morning to find that it was pouring outside. Worse, my freezer was wide open, causing me to gasp audibly.
After attempting to join two different yoga classes, without success, the couple headed to American Apparel store on Main Street for some shopping. Later they had a romantic dinner at AXE on Abbot Kinney in Venice. The couple are under watch as Jake is reported to plan to propose Reese. Could Axe restaurant could have been the perfect spot?
He was with Jake and Reese shopping in Venice, CA in the beggining of the year.
Each afternoon, Jane Heald and I would go back to our studio in Venice and try all we had seen that day. A pivotal moment for me was seeing Hamada Shoji pick up a bisqued salad bowl with the tips of his fingers just under the rim. He then dipped the whole pot into the glaze barrel for a few seconds, pulling it out and shaking off the excess to return that piece to the table. The glaze was later wiped off the foot, but he never touched up the fingermarks. I still have that piece(and the lesson in directness) and use it often at our table. In my studio, I use the lesson nearly every working day, trying to do 'just enough' and not more on each piece within a series of works.
At the London events, there were multiple placards deploying what has now become a commonplace image: the Jewish Star of David equated with the swastika. From the podium George Galloway declared: "Today, the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943."

Jake began his adult acting career thirty years before he was born, a time in which he was inspired by the first venture into space, Sputnik, a world away from the coal mines of West Virginia.
After the pool boarded Air Force One, following the president, it was observed that the Secret Service had not boarded, and we were told that the plane was "waiting." It eventually was learned that we were waiting for the arrival of a "World" airlines charter MD-11 carrying 292 Guardsmen and reservists for duty in Iraq. The plane departed from Ft. Bragg with the 30th Brigade Combat team, a guard unit from North Carolina, the 414th Transportation Batallian reserve unit from South Carolina, and the 230th Area Support Group, a guard unit from Tennessee. There seemed to be a few other units as well, such as the 150th armored cavalry, a guard unit from West Virginia. They are heading to Germany and then to Kuwait, for 18-24 months duty in Iraq. They were obviously excited to see the president, and a few confessed to being down when they had to say goodbye to their families, but they said they were boosted by the president's appearance. They were reluctant to talk about the mission in Iraq, appearing stoic about that. They were all wearing desert fatigues and filled virtually every seat on the 3-engine plane. The officers were seated in business class.
"A few months ago, a gay man died of a heart attack in West Virginia after a sheriff refused to let the man's friend administer CPR.
After that, more than 500 delegates wait to be awarded in the latest-voting states. Besides Indiana and Oregon, those include Pennsylvania on April 22, North Carolina on May 6, West Virginia on May 13, Kentucky on May 20, and Montana and South Dakota on June 3.
Angelina Jolie loves Yorkshire and has been looking for a home in Yorkshire. Her eyes was set on a four-bedroom cottage in Richmond.
Once while skiing during a white-out near Zurich, I crashed through a safety fence and flew over a small cliff. I should have turned to follow the marked trail, but it was too late.

Super producer Rich Harrison - best known for his work with Beyonce ("Crazy in Love"), Amerie ("1 Thing"), Toni Braxton ("Take This Ring"), The Pussycat Dolls ("I Don't Need a Man") - has recently launched the official MySpace profile of his protÃ©gÃ© female-quartet who goes by the name of Rich Girl.
Here is the video for Amerie Rogers' new single "Why R U", taken from the singer/songwriter's upcoming 4th album, "In Love & War", which is due in August via Def Jam Records. The track was produced by The Buchanans, who previously collaborated with the artist on the tracks "Crush", "Not the Only One" and "Crazy Wonderful."

Why can't people, including liberals, get things straight? Listening to Democracy Now! this morning, both host Amy Goodman and guest Peter Kornbluh joined most of the corporate media in claiming that Fidel Castro &quot;resigned&quot; today. He did no such thing; what he did, as he clearly explains , is to decline to run for re-election as President (&quot;President of the State Council&quot; officially). Failing to explain that properly is a political decision, because it implies that Fidel has not been re-elected repeatedly during the last 49 years, but has been unilaterally holding on to an office from which he could only depart by &quot;resigning&quot; (or dying). Lyndon B. Johnson also declined to run for a second term (in a move that was probably more surprising than Fidel's decision today), and I doubt you'll find a single reference to him &quot;resigning&quot; the Presidency.

Do you guys remember the beautiful little girl in the movie "Diary of a Mad Black Woman"? Well her name is Tiffany Evans, and she's currently in the process of recording her sophomore album with the likes of Balewa Muhammed (Christina Aguilera, Ciara) and Candice Nelson (Fantasia, Brandy). "Girls Gone Wild" and "WatchuTalkinBout" are among the newly recorded songs for the album. If you haven't heard her yet, I strongly recommend listening to the track I've uploaded ... It's called "Thinkin' About", and it was produced by my favourite production team Soulshock & Karlin (Toni Braxton, Kelly Rowland, Blu Cantrell). Don't forget to post your thoughts!
Our short tenure as the world's lone superpower has come to an end. As Harvard economics professor Benjamin Friedman has written: "Again and again it has always been the world's leading lending country that has been the premier country in terms of political influence, diplomatic influence and cultural influence. It's no accident that we took over the role from the British at the same time that we took over the job of being the world's leading lending country. Today we are no longer the world's leading lending country. In fact we are now the world's biggest debtor country, and we are continuing to wield influence on the basis of military prowess alone."

As the process of recording their sophomore release reaches its climax, The Veronicas are already calling their upcoming "Hook Me Up" their best work to date. Due November 3rd in Australia, the set is led by its title track, which is headed to radio imminently. The joint in question was written by Shelly Peiken (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Paris Hilton) and produced by Greg Wells (Lindsay Lohan, Che Dorval). Expect additional collaborations on the Warner Bros. album by Jonathan "J.R." Rotem (Ashley Tisdale - "He Said, She Said" / The Cheetah Girls - "Do No Wrong" / Rihanna - "Push Up On Me").
As previously reported, The Veronicas will release their upcoming sophomore album - "Hook Me Up" - in Australia on November 3rd via Sire/Warner Bros records. The set will be preceded by lead single "Hook Me Up", co-written by Shelly Peiken (Ashley Parker Angel, Lindsay Lohan) and produced by Greg Wells (Paris Hilton, Che Dorval). Other collaborators on the disc include Billy Steinberg (Celine Dion, Whitney Houston), Josh Alexander (Leona Lewis, Katharine McPhee) and Toby Gad (Elizabeth Withers, Keke Palmer).
Word around town is that during the New Year's holiday, Chris Breezy popped the question to Rihanna and she gladly said YES!! Congrats to the two love birds! If they have a daughter they should name her Brianna and call her Bri Bri for short! ;)
This little cutie pie baby happens to be Chris Brown's first artist on his new label "CBE" through Interscope and his name is Scooter Smiff ! He just featured his new video on BET's, Access Granted. The name of the song is " Head Of My Class " featuring Chris Breezy. You may have caught the show this evening but if you didn't, check out the snippet below:
Chris Johnson: Johnson had just 13 tackles last season, and the Raiders currently have 11 defensive backs on their roster. This a journeyman who can travel elsewhere.
(Contacted by Fortune, Hansen acknowledges that his 1988 projections were based on a model that "slightly" overstated the warming created by a doubling in CO2 levels. His new model posits a rise of 3 degrees Celsius in global temperatures by 2100, vs. 4.2 degrees in the old one. Says Hansen, "The projections that the public has been hearing about are based on a climate sensitivity that is consistent with the global warming rate of the past few decades." Christy's response: "Hansen at least admits his 1988 forecasts were wrong, but doesn't say they were way wrong, not 'slightly,' as he states." Christy also claims that even Hansen's revised models grossly overestimated the amount of warming that has actually occurred.)
Also, don't forget about Clifford Heath's Hax Day is on next Saturday [1]. At the Ruby Xmas Drinks I overheard some of the proposed projects, it's gonna be a cracker! So make sure you're there!
I totally agree, WDW. When people are out in public it's pretty much "fair game" so maybe a person might not like being "shot" at a tennis match or a ball game, but it happens. Ironically, I'm sure there are ppl with camera phones inside all the trendy LA nightclubs. But seldom, IF EVER, are there any pictures of celebs (Paris Hilton excluded.She has her own camera!!!LOL!!!.)We very rarely see what is going on inside the confines of a nightclub. Thank goddess! Unfortunately, ever since the Rome FF spread in PEOPLE magazine, I think a lot more people are aware of J&R and want to get in on being "stalkerazzi." Some agencies even offer bounties to 'non-professionals.' I had no idea of all these semi-obscure connections, felicia! Alex Greenwald and Claire Oswalt aren't names I'm at all familiar with, but Jason Schwartzman I've heard of. Isn't he Sophia Coppola's cousin? I think I once saw a picture of him sometime ago with Jake and the SNL guy, Andy Samberg joking around. And both Andy Samberg and Adam Levine are rumored to have dated Kirsten. I know. I need a life. LOL!
Pop artist Jeannie Ortega is currently working on 2 albums simultaneously, and even though no release date has been confirmed, the "Crowded" singer has collaborated with musicians such as Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald (Avril Lavigne, Kelis Rogers), The Conglomerate: Curtis Richardson & Charli Vox (Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Lopez) and Ruth-Anne Cunningham (Leona Lewis, Katharine McPhee).
Those involved in drafting the memos included John Yoo, a lawyer at the Justice Department; David Addington, Cheneys legal counsel; and Alberto Gonzales, then-White House Counsel.
I have never personally encountered a mild preterist. I have only encountered them in books like Isbon T. Beckwith's The Apocalypse of John. Today, most of those calling themselves preterists would fit into the moderate camp. Those like R.C. Sproul, Kenneth Gentry, Gary DeMar, Gary North, and Greg Bahnsen belong in this group. However, extreme preterism is growing and has made noticeable gains in recent years. Although David Chilton's books on preterism are from the moderate perspective, he did convert to extreme preterism before his recent death. Other extreme preterists include: Max King, John Bray, Ed Stevens, and Walt Hibbard.

Ellen DeGeneres has purchased $100,000 of media time to air her No On 8 PSA. Via press release:
Other songwriters backing the "Surveillance" singer on the project are Victoria "Lady V" Horn (Keyshia Cole, Christina Milian), Makeba Riddick (Toni Braxton, Jennifer Lopez), Terius "The Dream" Nash (Rihanna Fenty, Mary J. Blige) and Delisha Thomas (Beyonce Knowles, Janet Jackson).
To quote another more successful documentary from 2006, "It's not so much a political issue as it is a moral issue..." The subject of this doc is the mysterious and fear-inspiring MPAA rating system. I got a call today at work from a producer who uttered the phrase "I just heard from the MPAA" with a pathetic quiver reminiscent of a child waking from the nightmare. Filmmaker Kirby Dick gives the hard-hitting expose structure a lighthearted touch that works to a degree but ultimately keeps any non-cinephile at a comfortable distance.

You'll find a ton of people online who bash Professional Forex Traders as a bunch of thieves reaching into your pocket to steal your cash while they bring home the real money. Those people are completely missing the point. They bash the Forex System Sellers because they don't know how to use their methods to dominate the markets and rake in profits that'll make them feel like Donald Trump. And when people don't understand something, they badmouth it to make other people think they know what they're talking about. Well, we're here to tell you that the Forex System Sellers aren't the bad guys. Claiming the Forex System Sellers are at fault when some ignorant traders lose their shirts on runaway trading methods is like blaming a gun manufacturer when somebody gets shot. Guns don't shoot peopleâ people do! In the same way, the Forex System Sellers don't steal money from people âthey're own ignorance is what costs them. The truth hurts, but we're not going to soften the blow. So the bad news is that ignorance of how to use Forex Systems can leave you destitute and frustrated. But here's the good news... Trading Forex is a tool, not some magic genie in a bottle. If you try to use it without knowing how, it'll be like picking up a running chainsaw by the sharp end. Not a smart move. ... http://fxarmagedx.blogspot.com/#
Donald Trump was on Cavuto, tonight, and said that he may leave New York, since many of his associates will be leaving New York, due to the high taxes on the rich just enacted there. Â He's not alone. Â I've heard stories of about 2-3 major corporations leaving New York due to these taxes.
Jake Gyllenhaal is hot, that's for sure, even when the sweat is sprayed on. Huge thanks to Ed Zwick for giving us a hot, running Jake in Love and Other Drugs as well as thanks to IHJ for letting us enjoy it before the film comes out, And did I mention the arms? How does one get a job as a Jake Gyllenhaal Sweat Sprayer?
'Casting forces for filmmaker Ed Zwick have been talking to candidates to play the father of Jake Gyllenhaal in Zwickâs âLove and Other Drugsâ film also starring Anne Hathaway. The ideal actor should be between 55 and 60 years old and it couldnât hurt if he has gorgeous blue-green eyes with long lashes like Jakeâs. But anyway, the character is a doctor who disapproves of his sonâs career as a pharmaceutical sales guy. Also being cast for the flick, which rolls in September, are his younger brother and mom.'
'Director Ed Zwick (The Last Samurai, Defiance) has tapped Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway to star in LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS. 20th Century Fox and New Regency are financing the film which will begin shooting on September 21st 2009. Scott Stuber, Edward Zwick, Marshall Herskovitz and Pieter Jan Brugge are producing the film. Charles Randolph wrote the screenplay which has been rewritten by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. I've been able to confirm that this project is the former UNTITLED CHARLES RANDOLPH which was featured in the 2007's Black List. Here's the synopsis:âA humorous expose of the highly competitive and cutthroat world of pharmaceuticals, where salesmen schmooze doctors, nurses and hospitals to get them to use their brand of drugs.â'
It has been officially confirmed via Sony BMG that Natalie Imbruglia's forthcoming album, "Glorious: The Singles", will be released on 10th September. The collection will include past hits such as "Torn", "Beauty On The Fire" (my favorite), "Wrong Impression", "Shiver", as well as 2 new songs. The Australian pop artist released her last studio album, "Counting Down The Days", on 19th April 2005, and among the songwriters/producers on that set were Kara Dioguardi (Christina Aguilera, Nicole Scherzinger), Shep Solomon (Britney Spears, Paris Hilton), Eg White (Mutya Buena, Simon Webbe) and Matt Prime (Jamelia, Victoria Beckham).
According to Mutya Buena's official website, "Just a Little Bit" will the third single lifted from her debut album - "Real Girl". The joint was co-written by Pam Sheyne (Corinne Bailey Rae, Christina Aguilera) and produced by Eg White (Javine, Natalie Imbruglia). What do you think of this choice?
I knew Olmert wasn't religious, but I can't believe that even a secular would make a statement so inane. Is he that desperate to place all of Israel in such danger, by returning to "Auschwitz" borders? I read his list, and the only "possible" friend I see there is Sarkozy. Bush, Merkel, Brown, and Blair are friends? With friends like those, Israel surely needs no enemies! There is a hand of might in all of this, but It's not G-d's hand. It belongs to the one Stan names in the closing sentence. May G-d truly help Israel; with idiots like Olmert still in place, He's the only One who can help. ------------------------------------------------------ Olmert sees 'hand of God' in 'peace' process By Stan Goodenough Jan 01, 2008 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Monday he believes he can almost see "the hand of God" in the coming together of purportedly Israel-friendly countries which are working to create a Palestinian state on the historical homeland of the Jewish people. In an exclusive interview timed to coincide with the start of 2008, Olmert told The Jerusalem Post he believed the current constellation of key international personalities who were "favorably disposed" to Israel created "comfortable conditions" for negotiations that may not exist again in the future. The prime minister, a secular Jew, said it is "a coincidence that is almost 'the hand of God' that Bush is president of the United States, that Nicolas Sarkozy is the president of France, that Angela Merkel is the chancellor of Germany, that Gordon Brown is the prime minister of England and that the special envoy to the Middle East is Tony Blair." "What possible combination could be more comfortable for the State of Israel?" Olmert maintained that it was imperative that Israel make every effort towards progress in the land-for-peace process as long as this lineup of friendly faces remains in place. It is an historical irony that Israel-friendly world leaders have been more successful in their push for the division of Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel)than have outspokenly antagonistic prime ministers and presidents. Observers have noted that Israel's tendency towards dependancy on other countries - especially the United States - and the readiness of its leaders to be pressured as they pursue foreign favor has made the Jewish state exceptionally vulnerable to manipulation. There is a saying in Israel, that after centuries of antisemitism and decades of non-stop war and terrorism, the nation is desperate enough to "sell its soul to the devil" for peace.

Organizers of last summer's boycott of the Toronto International Film Festival who are now turning their sights to a student film festival in Tel Aviv have inadvertently raised the ire of two of Hollywood's biggest stars, director James Cameron and actress Jane Fonda.
I want Jane Fonda back. I know that really goes without saying, but dammit I wish she'd get off her arse and make a great movie again. I know there are whisper's that she's being chased to portray the lead in August: Osage County and that's certainly an interesting step in the right direction (or so I've heard about the show itself), but I don't understand why someone such as Fonda isn't out there trying to find some great movie roles. People clearly still want to cast her, but I just wish they'd cast her in something that's... well, that's not Georgia Rule , ya know?

They apparently had a reputation in the upper echelons of New York society in which they once mixed as a couple for being a political team with clout - both made donations to George Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.
The Pope did say that "What is needed is a deeper search for ways of pre-empting and managing conflicts by exploring every possible diplomatic avenue, and giving attention and encouragement to even the faintest sign of dialogue or desire for reconciliation." As I recall, George Bush said pretty much the same thing before invading and destroying Iraq. He explored "every possible diplomatic avenue" to avoid the "need" to attack Iraq.
You and I trust Hillary to lead America in a bold new direction -- to fix the problems George Bush leaves behind and to accomplish goals we once thought were out of reach.
Incidentally, the reason that travel ban was ostensibly removed in conference committee was the threat of a veto of the bill by George Bush. Considering that a majority of both houses of Congress have expressed their strong support for an end to the travel ban, a very easy position for both Obama and Clinton to take would be to promise not to veto such a bill if passed again. Neither has done so. Nor, by the way, have the Democrats even brought up the bill again since they took control of Congress.

In America, circa 2008, supporters of non-sanctioned political candidates fall victim to having their car tires slashed and are molested at political rallies for the crime of not enthusiastically supporting candidates selected by our rulers. In order to underscore the danger present, corporate media hacks such as Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly, reading from their Mockingbird scripts, warn of danger and violence to come, equating such people with homegrown terrorists and potentially violent lunatics.

When winter strikes the Western Hemisphere, the folks in Down Under experience glorious summer days. Here you can see Hugh Jackman taking full advantage of that as he and his family spend some quality time in Sydney, Australia at Bondi Beach. Jackman played quite a bit in the pool with his cutie pie daughter Ava and his son Oscar. After a few hours of pool cavorting, Hugh spent some âme timeâ in the surf to cool down before heading home with the family. Awwwâ¦.what a cutie!! And the little one is precious lookinâ as well!
ARDEN: Ok. So we both agree that the film looks great. And if you were on some sort of drug, it would probably look even better. But as far as the point of the whole Godforsaken thing, we're going on a combination of plot holes and an "ending-ish". It was sort of about Hugh Jackman and how much he loved Rachel Weisz, right?

State of Play isn't reinventing the wheel, but it does succeed in being a well-made drama/thriller that doesn't always use the easy options (doesn't always, but sometimes does). It wastes throwaway story-lines, that were obviously more prevalent in the British extended TV series, and the actors involved in them (that would be Wright-Penn and Jeff Daniels), but it provides enough fire to make for a rousing piece of movie entertainment.

"The numbers are still up a little bit, but the types of penalties were better than years past," Coach Jeff Fisher said.
When the Titans checked Indianapolis 16-10 last week in the game that fed Jeff Fisher's squad into the postseason, Vanden Bosch did not have a sack, but he registered two tackles, two quarterback pressures and helped limit the Colts to 46 rushing yards and 194 total yards.
San Diego (11-5) has won five straight, with a record of 9-3-1 at home, and leads 22-13-1 overall. Titans coach Jeff Fisher has yet to beat the Chargers in four games.
WE DON'T NEED YOUR "CELEBRITIES". Television would be so much better without the likes of Seinfeld, Koppel, Wallace, Rivera, Larry King, Barbara Walters and, not to forget, Jerry Springer. We remember when Jews created good movies and good TV series because the Jewish owners of studios and stations had to be careful not to insult the sensibilities of the white viewers and listeners? Now, with your power and influence being nearly limitless, you believe you do not have to mind us anymore, and your true tastes and inclinations come to the fore.

I have to link to this . Doctor Mooney's 115th Dream is a blog where those who might wish to do so can download mp3 files, perish the thort... One of his recent offerings is my all-time favourite Johnny Cash song One Piece At A Time . Apparently the record company had an auto spares guy cobble together a car like the one on the song as a promtional tool, and they presented it to the Man In Black. There is a wonderful picture on Doctor Mooney's site (and on Wikipedia) of JC in the "psychobilly Cadillac".
This sermon by Jonathan Edwards takes its provenance from 1 Corinthians 1:29-31. This lesson is one we, as Christians, are rightly to be reminded from time to time so as to keep our forcus on Him. I hope you will receive edification from this sermon.
Speaking of the damned...Jordin is dressed and painted up just like a groupie for the 1983-84 iteration of that very group. What is it about "Broken Wing" that makes everyone stupid?

UPDATE II: Well, THAT didn't go very well did it? I found much of the argument delivered on our behalf to be hesitant and on occasion, almost laughably bumbled. In particular, California Deputy Attorney General Christopher Krueger seemed completely out of his league, tripping over his words and inserting a too-casual "ya know" into every other sentence. Horrible. On the other hand, Chief Deputy San Francisco Attorney Therese Stewart was highly articulate and forceful. She rocked. But sadly, I must admit that Ken Starr earned his coin today, he was as smooth as a snake. It seems to me that Justice Joyce Kennard is poised to reverse her earlier vote in support of marriage equality, swinging the court to a 4-3 vote against us. I don't think things bode well for us. I sure hope I'm wrong.
"Disaster. They constantly interrupted the gay side with aggressive questions, but let Ken Starr go on and on and on. They were obsessed with the fact that the domestic-partnership law gives the same rights as marriage, and they completely ignored the fact that they so eloquently argued that separate isn't equal in their previous ruling. They seemed enamored of the notion that the people can do almost whatever they want via the ballot-box amendment process -- including repealing freedom of speech, banning gay adoption, pretty much any damned thing they choose. We're not winning this one. It could even be unanimous." - Reporter Rex Wockner , writing on his blog about yesterday's CA Supreme Court hearings.

Hello CMFG, As requested, here is your CMT.com Artist Update for LeAnn Rimes.
Hi bmg - oh I love that gallery - not necessarily all the art but I love the architecture around it. I know what you mean about playing it cool. When I was in Beverly Hills this year I saw Leo DiCaprio and I played it so, so cool - barely glancing up from my smoothy. Easier to do whern they're not Jake! Thanks for commenting :)
Remember all those Farragut North readings and rumours from 2007/2008? Well, now the play is cast and ready to go - not with Jake Gyllenhaal as the lead, not even with Leo DiCaprio, but with James T Kirk Chris Pine at the helm. So while we muse on what might have been, time to think on what was.
How does one steal the offspring of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony? I guess look for an ugly-assed baby w/ a HUGE ass and a little rat fink face. *shrugs shoulders*
There was also an issue as to who would take the photos. In this case, it wasn't which professional photographer would have access to the inner Lopez/Anthony sanctum - it was a matter of whether Marc Anthony, apparently a budding photographer, could snap the shots.

20 Questions With Merle Haggard http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1571426/20071008/riley_jeannie_c_.jhtml
Looking at whom they want as their next Governor in 2010: 32 percent pick New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; 30 percent want former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; 17 percent support Paterson; 13 percent name State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.
Hagel: New party needed? Republican suggests Iraq war may be remembered as historical blunder The Associated Press updated 8:03 a.m. CT, Thurs., March. 20, 2008 OMAHA, Neb. - U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel writes in a new book that the United States needs independent leadership and possibly another political party, while suggesting the Iraq war might be remembered as one of the five biggest blunders in history. "In the current impasse, an independent candidate for the presidency, or a bipartisan unity ticket ... could be appealing to Americans," Hagel writes in "America: Our Next Chapter," due in stores Tuesday. The Associated Press obtained an advance copy. The Nebraska Republican, who announced last year he wouldn't seek a third term or the GOP presidential nomination, had been widely mentioned as a running mate on an independent ticket with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg said last month he wouldn't run. 'Reckless foreign policy' Hagel said that despite holding one of the Senate's strongest records of support for President Bush, his standing as a Republican has been called into question because of his opposition to what he deems "a reckless foreign policy ... that is divorced from a strategic context." Hagel, who's been a harsh critic of the war since 2003, writes that the invasion of Iraq was "the triumph of the so-called neoconservative ideology, as well as Bush administration arrogance and incompetence." The Vietnam veteran said he had hoped the lessons from that war would give the nation's leaders perspective before troops were sent to Iraq. "To the astonishment of those of us who lived through the agony of Vietnam, these lessons were ignored in the run-up to the Iraq War," he writes. Hagel said Vice President Dick Cheney and others "cherry-picked intelligence" and used fear to intensify "war sloganeering." During visits to the Middle East in December 2002, Hagel said, Israel's top security officials asked, "Do you really understand what you are getting yourselves into?" Hagel said Bush personally assured him that he would exhaust diplomatic avenues before committing troops to Iraq. The senator said he voted for the war resolution based on those assurances, but regrets the vote because it's now clear that lawmakers were presented with lies and wishful thinking. Last year, Hagel was the only member of his party on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to support a nonbinding measure critical of Bush's decision to dispatch an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq. "There is no strategy. This is a pingpong game with American lives," Hagel said at the time. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I believe that Eris is something involved because I believe it has to do with divergence,diversity,equal rights matters. The mythology,the highly eccentric orbit which is Persephone-like,involves being well off the ecliptic unlike the planets. Ceres and Pluto were made equals as dwarf planets because of the discovery of Eris. Ceres was once classed as a major planet and was stripped of its planetary status,and now Pluto has been given the same treatment. Demeter/Ceres and Hades/ Pluto were forced to share Persephone/Proserpina. Eris' co-discoverer, Dr. Michael Brown says that Eris has a Persephone-like orbit in that half of the time,it orbits away from Pluto. He thought Persephone or Proserpina were suitable name for Eris,but the names were already given to asteroids.
Former DHS Secretary Says He Sees 'A Lot Of Continuity' Between AdministrationsIn a recent interview with NationalJournal.com, former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff differed with two of his Bush administration colleagues -- backing away from statements by former Vice President Dick Cheney that President Obama had made the country less safe and slamming former FEMA Director Michael Brown as "obviously bitter." Chertoff had nicer things to say about the current White House, praising the Obama administration for continuing Bush-era policies like the MÃ©rida Initiative to fund anti-drug efforts in Mexico and invoking the state secrets privilege. Since leaving government, the former secretary has started his own security consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. Edited excerpts of his conversation with Alina Selyukh follow.

Hey Monnie O! Love the new Atti name! (even though I'm jealous...). The soggy red carpet is over now. It feels funny watching it with no Jake and no me there in the freezing cold, and none of my friends and no Heath. I do hope the stars realise how many hours fans have to queue for the valuable wristbands for the red carpet.

Neil Gaimen is a Highly Respected Author. I really enjoyed Stardust so I guess, it's either a case of sticking it out or it's a more poorer choice of his books.
Another PNAC signatory, author Norman Podhoretz, laid bare the ideological impetus behind the third aspect of PNAC's grand plan in the September 2002 issue of his politics and policy journal, "Commentary." Podhoretz noted the regimes "that richly deserve to be overthrown and replaced, are not confined to the three singled-out members of the axis of evil. At a minimum, the axis should extend to Syria and Lebanon and Libya, as well as 'friends' of America like the Saudi royal family and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, along with the Palestinian Authority, whether headed by Arafat or one of his henchmen." Podhoretz concluded his argument by framing an Iraq invasion as being part of "the long-overdue internal reform and modernization of Islam."
In order to speed up and improve the entry procedures, we are hoping to make arrangements for the issuance of ID cards for media representatives in advance of the next Public Hearing, which is scheduled to begin on 4 February 2008 when the Pre-Trial Chamber will hear the appeal by Nuon Chea against provisional detention. If you intend to cover this event, please let us know.
Along with Nir Rosen and Patrick Cockburn, Jamail has been one of the few reporters who have covered the invasion and occupation of Iraq from outside the confines of the US "safety net" -- not just the Green Zone but the US propaganda mission that seeks to control how we view what has happened in Iraq. I picked this up from the library, and unfortunately didn't get very far into it -- too many other distractions, too little time. The following are a few quotes. With more time I'm sure I could have found more. Some day I will.

Re: Your imminent unemployment Greetings, Mr. Bush. I was sorry to hear about the passing of your cat, India. Eighteen years is a long time for a cat - my mother has one that's 20 and still going strong, if you can believe it - and I'm sure India had a comfortable, caring life with your family. I got to spend part of last weekend with an old friend of mine. He's a bit older than 18, and he's also a troop who recently rotated back from a tour in Falluja. He just had a baby daughter, and he will be sent to Afghanistan before too much longer. He did his duty in Iraq, dealt his share of death and saw his friends die or be ripped to shreds right in front of him. He was hollow in a lot of places that had been full before he went to Iraq. He was not the same man we'd said farewell to. But he was alive, and if he survives his upcoming Afghanistan tour, maybe he will get the chance to have a long, comfortable, caring life with his family, just like little India. At present, my friend's life is the polar opposite of comfortable, and he still has Kabul waiting for him just over the horizon. His life is the way it is because of you, Mr. Bush. You have been the single greatest influence upon his time in this world; you put him over there and hollowed him out, and because of you, it's about to happen again. You were the single biggest influence upon the lives of every person he knew over there, every person he saw over there, and every person he killed over there. It's funny. I was thinking the other day about when I marched in one of the first large-scale post-inauguration protests against you in Washington, DC. It was May of 2001, it was The Voter's Rights March to Restore Democracy, and it was a few thousand people shouting down the unutterably ruinous Supreme Court decision which unleashed, just as we then feared, everything that has since come to pass. "Not my president!" we bellowed. "Not my president!" It's funny because that memory seems so very quaint to me now. A stolen election? Pfff. To paraphrase a different president, Americans get scarier stuff than that free with their breakfast cereal nowadays. Thanks to you, governor. My All-Time-Grand-Prize-Bull-Goose-Gold-Medal-Winning Top Five list of what you've done, in no particular order, and in my own humble opinion: 1. You were warned by the outgoing administration when you first took office. You were warned by the Russians. You were warned by the Israelis. You were warned by the Germans. You were warned in a memo given to you by your own National Security Adviser. You were warned by men like Richard Clarke. You were warned all those times that Osama bin Laden intended to strike the United States, and still the Towers came down. (All those people working on that Legacy Project of yours should go back to bed, by the way; they are trying to salvage the unsalvageable. You protected us, they claim? Ha. You're 0-1 on terrorism and 0-2 on war) 2. Less than a month after those Towers came down, a reporter asked what you thought we should do. "We need to counter the shockwave of the evildoer," you replied, "by having individual rate cuts accelerated and by thinking about tax rebates." I happened to be watching television and heard you say that live into a camera. The only reason I didn't throw up on myself is because my teeth were clenched too tightly for the vomit to pass my lips. I swallowed hard, grabbed a pen, and wrote down what you said and when you said it. It was October 4, 2001, just after nine in the morning. You'd like people to remember you standing on that pile of rubble in Manhattan, you with the bullhorn and the heroic pose. I, however, will always remember you pitching tax cuts to a devastated nation while a pall of poison smoke still hung in the air over Ground Zero. Rest Here: http://www.truthout.org/010709J
Half an hour later, the young lass is just wiping her chin, when in walks Ringo Starr from the Beatles.
Democrat Al Franken will be declared the winner of the tight U.S. Senate contest in Minnesota, emerging from a ballot recount with a slim margin over Republican Norm Coleman, state officials said on Sunday. But Coleman, the incumbent, has asked Minnesota's supreme court to require that a few hundred additional absentee ballots be included in the recount -- and he could then ask the court to investigate the contest all over again. "At the moment, Franken has a 225-vote lead," after the weekend counting of what were deemed the last uncounted absentee ballots, said Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, a Democrat who oversaw the process. Ritchie said unless the supreme court acts on Coleman's request and orders more ballots to be counted, he will reconvene the state's Canvassing Board on Monday to certify Franken as the winner of the November 4 contest.
Mya -- the Grammy-winning singer known for such hits as "Case of the Ex," "Ghetto Superstar" and "Lady Marmalade" -- will join the Tony-winning revival of Kander and Ebb's Chicago in May. According to a press notice, the multi-platinum recording artist will begin performances as merry murderess Velma Kelly May 12 at the Ambassador Theatre. Mya will stay with the long-running musical through July 13 ... Mya's association with the razzle-dazzle world of Chicago dates back to 2003 when she played Mona in the Rob Marshall-directed film version of "Chicago." In a statement Chicago producer Barry Weissler said, "It's not often that one encounters a performer with the level of accomplishment that Mya brings to the table. She is a true triple-threat -- a wonderful actor, an amazing singer, and an insanely talented dancer. She has an incredible sense of drive, intensity and showmanship that I'm confident will make her portrayal of Velma Kelly unlike anything we've ever seen."
I went and saw Rob Marshall's Nine this afternoon. At first I thought I had walked into the wrong cinema since in the second row from the back of the quite small cinema they were screening the movie in sat a row of what looked to be 16-year-olds. Three girls and four boys. I don't know if they knew what movie they were going to see and I imagined similar scenes to when I saw Sweeney Todd and five minutes in a young guy screamed out "WHY ARE THEY SINGING?" before cursing Tim Burton during the closing credits.

Anyhoo, over the last few days the always spectacularly informed Mister Roger Friedman, who writes the fantabulous Fox 411 column, dished all kinds of dirt on the doings and the oh no they didn'ts concerning the foreclosure and re-fi fracas surrounding Neverland Ranch. If any of you kids have an unhealthy interest in The White Lady's real estate saga the way Your Mama (and apparently Mister Friedman) does, we strongly suggest you boogie your nosy booty over to Fox 411 to get the 411 on the situation (links above). In the event you don't have that kinda time or inclination, let Your Mama attempt to summarize the scandalous tidbits:
DL makes an extremely good point which it that there has been a significant lack of posts about Mark Ruffalo on this blog. This is not my fault. 2006 has not been a good year for Mr. Ruffalo. Or should I say it has not been a good year for Ruffalo fans.
In the meantime, Im realizing that Has Elroy, in the Zodiac commentary, was not speaking of Mark Ruffalo but himself, who was "hung like a mule". TMI, Jimmy. Macho writers annoy me. I would have liked to hear more from Jake and Robt.

Why did you send Sasha home after your date? a.) Like I said, I need to make sure I end up with someone who will be more than a fling for a couple years. Sasha's never been in love and never been hurt. He's not ready to be a husband. b.) I know I said I liked that story about how he almost died once in a car accident. But really, the whole time I was listening, I was like: Eeee too serious. (That's also why I sent him home on the bus. I was trying to be be considerate of his traumatized past. I also felt really dumb for making him drive that Ferrari earlier. Oops.) c.) I think he might have, like - problems. He said he was looking for a mythical unicorn, and I might be all the way from Canada, but I know unicorns don't exist. I hope he finds some help. d.) He has a girl's name!
Sasha 's description of Jake , saying he's probably had the same haircut since he was 6 years old.
I must take issue with the voices now being raised against Judge Antonin Scalia's contention that torture is not prohibited by the U.S. Constitution's explicit ban on "cruel and unusual punishment." Critics such as Scott Horton have offered withering denunciations of Scalia's claims, which were offered up in an interview with BBC radio this week. But I think they have underestimated the exquisite subtlety of Scalia's argument. Indeed, instead of rejecting this interpretation by a jurist widely praised for the sweaty muscularity of his intellect, I think we should embrace it, champion it -- and use it to put George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and a vast host of their minions in jail.
Zach and Miri Make a Porno - I saw this a few months ago and like a lot of Kevin Smith movies it was going alright until the weird sentimentality kicked in and it all turned to shite. Nevertheless, my affection for Seth Rogan continues on it's merry way. Why is that, I wonder? Elizabeth Banks is kind of wonderful too, but she's let down by the atrocious final act.
Kristen Bell , Jason Segel , Seth Rogan , Jonah Hill , Alyson Hannigan , Alexis Denisof and others were on hand for the LA premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, CA last night ... here are a few pics from the red carpet:
On Wednesday, March 19, Malik Zulu Shabazz of the New Black Panther Party appeared as a guest on "Hannity & Colmes" to discuss the Obama / Reverend Wright controversy. During that appearance, Sean Hannity asked Shabazz if Barak Obama shouldn't be judged by his past affiliations with Reverend Wright, to which Shabazz replied by asking Sean Hannity "Should you be judged by your past association with Hal Turner, a neo-Nazi?"
ORLANDO - When her lone opponent dropped out of the race, Orlando City Commissioner Patty Sheehan was left sitting on a pile of campaign cash with no campaign to spend it on. The law allows candidates to distribute their unused contributions to charities of their choice. On Tuesday, Sheehan presented a check for $25,000, most of her funds, to the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Community Center of Central Florida. The center at 946 N. Mills Ave. is raising money for a building fund. The group provides support and social programs to more than 15,000 people a year. Sheehan, who is gay, had about $43,000 left when challenger Sam Odom ended his candidacy in October, citing fundraising problems.
"Abdul Baha said that if an angel from heaven comes down and tries to change the teachings of Baha'u'llah, do not believe him. Shoghi Effendi has changed them by pronouncements and actions which are in direct contradiction to Bahai teachings--above all he has changed the very character and fundamental principle of the Cause by putting a theocracy, which the founders said it was not [boldface in original], in place of the spiritual democracy which they said, over and over again, it is. The following instances show what acceptance of the alleged will has done to the blind followers of its rules."
The one hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Bahai Religion will take place on May 23rd, 1944. Yet here also the Power within it has been more or less entombed due to the fact that since the passing of Abdul Baha from this world the organized group of Bahais (The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahais) under the dictatorship of Shoghi Effendi, have brought Fascism or totalitarianism into it.
Starr of Skull Gang and I had to take this picture together....we were the brightest chicks in the studio!! And killin em nonetheless:
Just one month after the launch of ABC's Darren Starr-produced "Cashmere Mafia," Starr's partner on the critically-acclaimed HBO classic "Sex and the City" Candace Bushnell's novel "Lipstick Jungle" will serve as a basis for yet another female-centric Big Apple-set dramedy. But have the viewers had enough?
The actress and her hockey player partner welcomed Stella Monroe Hulse on Wednesday morning, weighing 7 lbs. 3 oz (3.3 kilograms).

You face your attacker. It's going to be a close-range fight. Your assailant grabs you, and drops to the ground in pain. You already know this nerve strike. The beauty of this application is you execute your nerve strikes with your knee. Nerve Strikes From Childhood AnticsWhen you were a kid, did you ever receive (or give) a "Charlie Horse?" It's that sickeningly painful feeling you get when someone raps his or her knuckles on the center of one of your muscles. When we were kids, the older boys in the neighborhood would pound us a good one on the edge of the biceps or on the middle of the thigh. Boy, did those punches hurt -- a nerve strike, right on the muscle. Ouch. Using the Thigh Nerve StrikeEarly in my martial-arts studies with Steve Golden (original Bruce Lee and Ed Parker student), the more senior students reacquainted me with the nerve strike on the thigh muscle. Except, they executed their thigh nerve strikes with their knees. We would be in close, fighting. I would concentrate on the hands, and make the beginner's error of forgetting about the lower lines of attack....
The most recent "energy bill" passed by Congress and signed by the President actually bans Thomas Edison's most famous invention, the incandescent light bulb!
"Federal Reserve proposal was unconstitutional from its inception, because the Federal Reserve System was to be a bank of issue. Article 1, Sec. 8, Par. 5 of the Con- stitution expressly charges Congress with "the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof.". Warburg's plan would deprive Congress of its sovereignty, and the systems of checks and balances of power set up by Thomas Jefferson in the Constitution would now be destroyed. Administrators of the proposed system would control the nation's money and credit, and would them- selves be approved by the executive department of the government. The judicial department (the Supreme Court, etc.) was already virtually controlled by the executive department through presidential appointment to the bench. [....]
When fundamentalism grew into a mass political movement in the 1970s and '80s, Western analysts feared that a new generation of repressive theocrats would make traditional Muslim strongmen like Mubarak look as democratic as Thomas Jefferson. And such fears have been borne out in a number of places. Fundamentalist regimes in Sudan and Afghanistan are brutal and undemocratic.
"More and more of our national and international questions are religiously inflected," he says, citing President Bush's speeches laden with biblical references and the furor when the first Muslim member of Congress chose to be sworn in with his right hand on Thomas Jefferson's Quran.
The first official Republican meeting took place on July 6th, 1854 in Jackson, Michigan. The name "Republican" was chosen because it alluded to equality and reminded individuals of Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.
Vanilla Ice has been released from custody after he was arrested yesterday for domestic battery but he has been ordered to stay away from the wife he pushed.

A top official at the Pentagon during former-President George H. W. Bush's Administration and a former CIA intelligence officer maintain that Barack Obama and former Weather Underground honcho William Ayers funneled money to Professor Rashid Khalidi, a known terrorist sympathizer.
In 1995, State Senator Alice Palmer introduced her chosen successor, Barack Obama, to a few of the district's influential liberals at the home of two well known figures on the local left: William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn.
* William Ayers was a former member of the Weathermen, a revolutionary Marxist organization that engaged in bombings. Ayers had no regrets in his group's terrorist activities which included bombings of the United States Senate and Pentagon; Ayers was quoted saying, "I don't regret setting bombs; I feel we didn't do enough." Ayers is now a college professor. Obama praised Ayers concerning an article he wrote on the juvenile justice system in Chicago. Ayers and Obama served together on the board of the Woods Fund of Chicago. Ayers gave Obama a $200 donation for his reelection for state senate of Illinois.
Over the last several months I've been talking to many people out of Illinois, as well as people beyond Obama's stomping grounds, who knew of the connection with Barack Obama and the domestic terrorist couple Bernardine Dohrn and William Ayers.

Did you see my other post about obama and ACORN or did you see it and choose not to comment because it hurt too much? --
To say that we are in troubling times is a huge understatement. We have an organization like ACORN running around the country in a blatant attempt to steal an election. We have a Democrat presidential candidate garnering huge support by talking about "hope" and "change" while never being questioned about his socialist agenda. We have the media carrying his water. And, of course, we have the media, whose blatant bias for Barack Obama throws the integrity of the whole profession into question.
A bit OT: to all the gyllenbabble peeps in the NY area: The AMPAS will be having a meet the Oscars promo. Anyone can stop by at the shops at 10 Columbus Circle at the Time Warner Center, Level 2 and get your picture taken with an Oscar! It's free today - Saturday from 10am - 9pm and Sunday from 7am - 7pm. Guess where i'll be after work today!!
However, that being said, I think the nominees will be - Clooney, Day-Lewis, Depp, Mortensen and I really wanna say Josh Brolin will get a surprise nom but only a few people have gotten an Oscar nod without a GG or SAG nomination, so the final spot, I say, goes to McAvoy. I don't have any reasoning for it, I just think AMPAS will like it.

I took some time on Sunday afternoon to read Warren Buffett's annual letter. I don't make it an annual practice to read the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A) letter as many do (nor have I ever been to the shareholders' meeting which Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists"). But given that 2008 was a year unlike any that I have ever witnessed, it seemed like the thing to do on a cold and snowy afternoon.

It is the quickness of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which some think in terms of being a Biased Broadcasting Corporation to feature the above topic that strikes many as amazing and almost as though it was in agreement with the critic Symon Hill who belongs to an anti arms trade campaigning group who has criticised the sale of 10,000 military missiles by Slovakia to Sri Lanka. Come now BBC can you not do better than sing in unison with an canary who sounds as though he just might be on the payroll of the Tamil Tiger terrorists in their desperate hour ?
Carlyle Capital Corp (CCC) is a separate legal and business entity from U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group, and the group said last week that the listed fund would not have a measurable impact on Carlyle's other funds, investments and portfolio companies.

The military invasion of the Gaza Strip by Israeli Forces bears a direct relation to the control and ownership of strategic offshore gas reserves. This is a war of conquest. Discovered in 2000, there are extensive gas reserves off the Gaza coastline. British Gas (BG Group) and its partner, the Athens based Consolidated Contractors International Company (CCC) owned by Lebanon's Sabbagh and Koury families, were granted oil and gas exploration rights in a 25 year agreement signed in November 1999 with the Palestinian Authority. The rights to the offshore gas field are respectively British Gas (60 percent); Consolidated Contractors (CCC) (30 percent); and the Investment Fund of the Palestinian Authority (10 percent).

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Jiang Yu announced the meeting at a regular press briefing in Beijing.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a solemn representation with the Beijing office of Cable News Network (CNN) on Wednesday evening, condemning the network as "without any professional reputation". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao, who is also the Director-General of the Ministry's Information Department, said that a statement issued by CNN on Tuesday failed to apologize for its host Jack Cafferty's remarks, which maliciously attacked the Chinese people and seriously violated the professional ethics of journalism.

The City Council already has approved the scope of work for the study, and the county Board of Supervisors is set to vote on it Tuesday. In a memo before the vote, Huckelberry cited advances in the treatment of wastewater in urging greater use be made of "recycled water." "A substantial investment is being made to significantly improve the water quality of reclaimed water, making it more reusable as recycled water," Huckelberry wrote. "It will be important that this billion-dollar investment be productively used to increase the region's water supply over the next 20 years." Currently, reclaimed water is used only for watering grass at parks and golf courses.

But when the DHS released a warning about right wing extremists and the danger they pose, Michelle Malkin and Newsbusters went up in arms saying that the DHS was targeting all conservatives. Duh. If I were a conservative, I'd give her a piece of my mind. After all, in all fairness not all conservatives are anti-government, pro-gun bigots who'd like to see Obama dead. I'm sure that many of you know wingnuts who would like to see bad things happen to the president but you don't automatically lump them together with everyone who voted for McCain. More on this

In September they took a tour in America's Masonic capitol Washington D.C. where Dominic wore a highly symbolic (duality/"elite" European families/Freemasonry) double headed eagle shirt (which aren't exactly hard to find, everyone is wearing the "elite's" iconography these days it seems, must be a global case of Stockholm syndrome ;p) with a sun behind it (which feels especially ritualistic considering the symbolism of the phallic Washington Monument situated behind him, phallic obelisks such as that are associated with Egyptian Sun worshiping cults; + the eagle has been said to really represent a phoenix ).

Sometimes we waste enormous energy seeking something God never promised. We want a guarantee. We want to know it's all going to work out. We want all the uncertainty taken away. After preaching on this a few years ago, a man came up and said, "What you're saying is, 'We've still got to choose.'" Bingo! We've still got to choose. It's going to be Wisconsin or Washington, dental school or the Army, Georgia Tech or Wheaton, Mike or John Mark, an SUV or a Mini-Cooper, a Mac or a PC, buying a new house or fixing up the one you have. You choose this doctor and that treatment and not some other doctor or some other treatment. And so it goes through all the decisions of life.

Today's the day that the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) publishes the report it commissioned from the Intellectual Property Institute, London, into the impact of the controversial resale royalty rights for artists on the UK art market. This right (see earlier IPKat posts hereand here) was introduced in 2006, when the UK reluctantly but dutifully implemented a European Directive on that subject.Right: paintings by cats have been excluded from the Directive, presumably on account of the copyright issues arising from their having nine livesAt the time the right was introduced, there were concerns that it would increase costs for the art industry. Examining in detail the costs and benefits of the right for both the UK art market and its artists, today's report indicates that the right has not had a significant impact on the art trade -- but there may be some difficulties with the way the system is running.Left: artistic works are protected by copyright "irrespective of artistic merit" -- which presumably applies to resale royalty rights too.The real Baroness Morgan has announced that the UKIPO is to launch a consultation this summer aimed at ensuring that the UK maintains a system that allows the art market to succeed.In short, the right currently applies to works created by live artists. From 2010 the right will also apply to works created by artists who have been dead for fewer than 70 years. The consultation will look at the possibility of continuing to exclude deceased artists until 2012. The UKIPO is having a summer party at which it will publish its consultation paper and discuss the findings of the IPI report, as well as reports produced by others in the resale right arena.If you want to read the report, you can download the PDF version here. The authors are Katy Graddy, Noah Horowitz and Stefan Szymanski. The report runs to 103 pages and it's packed with genuine data -- the first 39 pages seem to be the operative bit, though.Says the IPKat, it's good to see the Intellectual Property Institute getting involved in projects like this: the IPI has the enthusiasm and the know-how to supervise IP research projects, delivering them on time and within budget. He wishes he'd been involved in this one. But Merpel asks, is this another case of the plain truth being spoiled by the real facts?Why cats paint hereWhy Katz paints here
The Intellectual Property Institute (IPI) has posed the question âwhy is IP so misunderstood or unloved by so many people?â Those who work with IP know how valuable IP is in so many dimensions. So, in marketing terms, the IPI asks, why is IP âa tainted brandâ and, more importantly, what can be done about it?Last autumn the IPI commissioned some research into public understanding of, and attitudes concerning, IP. The results of this research, which are to be the baseline for further discussion and analysis, will be presented by the lead researcher, Dr Roya Ghafele, in London next week. She will be introducing her findings on Monday 10 March at the office of Olswang, solicitors (90 High Holborn, London WC1V 6XX), from 2pm to 5pm.There are still a small number of places available for interested participants. If you'd like to be considered for one of them, email Anne Goldstein here at the IPI as soon as possible. If you have any relevant expertise, please let Anne know. The IPKat adds, there is no charge for admission.

Yeah, you can jump in and try to learn on your own. But we'll guarantee that you'll lose money. Just giving your money away like that and not making anything doesn't seem very productive. The way to make money in the Forex market is by predicting a price movement of a currency pair and investing right before and exiting right after. This usually happens a few times in a day. Real day traders and professional traders do just that, hence the name "day" traders. Huge companies like Citi Group and JP Morgan Chase do this every single day and employ thousands of professionals that do it for them.
Over the weekend several news sources reported a near-fatal attack on a 15-year-old boy who received a Purim basket. Here are some of the links to that story: Ynet News, Jerusalem Newswire, Jerusalem Post. Amiz Ortiz was seriously wounded after a parcel bomb in the form of a Purim gift blew up in his face. He is the son of a messianic Jewish family in Ariel.
A Conflict of Cultures and Values David Wilder March 31, 2008 This morning one of the headlines adorning the Jerusalem Post reads, "Israel mulls PA troops in Hebron." When called the previous evening for a reaction to this story, one of the points I made was, "Israel is allowing armed terrorists to 'legally' return to Jenin. After the number of soldiers we lostÂ in JeninÂ cleaning out the terrorist nests there, I really don't understand how we can allow them back!"
David Harris of the American Jewish Committee writes " http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/harris/entry/what_happens_when_the_shoe " on his Jerusalem Post blog about the refusal of a New York Times-owned radio station to air a commercial condemning Palestinian rocket attacks against the Israeli town of Sderot. [According to the stations] logic, the only way to broadcast the plight of Sderots residents over the airwaves is to equate Israels right of self-defense with Hamass and Islamic Jihads right to strike Israel at will. I can only imagine what would have been the response had we done a spot during the London blitz. Would it have been turned down as well, perhaps on the grounds that we failed to refer to reciprocal British military actions against Nazi Germany?

The night's carnage left some 3,000 African Americans dead, and over 600 successful businesses lost. Among these were 21 churches, 21 restaurants, 30 grocery stores and two movie theaters, plus a hospital, a bank, a post office, libraries, schools, law offices, a half-dozen private airplanes and even a bus system. As could be expected, the impetus behind it all was the infamous Ku Klux Klan, working in consort with ranking city officials, and many other sympathizers. In their self-published book, Black Wall street: A lost Dream, and its companion video documentary, Black Wall street: A Black Holocaust in America!, the authors have chronicled for the very first time in the words of area historians and elderly survivors what really happened there on that fateful summer day in 1921 and why it happened. Wallace similarly explained to Black Elegance why this bloody event from the turn of the century seems to have had a recurring effect that is being felt in predominately Black neighborhoods even to this day. The best description of Black Wall street, or Little Africa as it was also known, would be to liken it to a mini-Beverly Hills. It was the golden door of the Black community during the early 1900s, and it proved that African Americans had successful infrastructure. That's what Black Wall street was about.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise and his business partner Paula Wagner made a deal with MGM late last year to resurrect the flatlining United Artists movie studio (known for Pink Panther, Rocky and James Bond franchises) and, with the blessing from Merril Lynch worth $500 million, manage the studio and oversee the production of new blockbusters, many of which will star Tom Cruise.

The first cable network to televise a musical in its entirety, MTV will follow the success of its "Legally Blonde The Musical" special by again partnering with the musical team for the reality competition series "Legally Blonde The Musical: The Search For Elle Woods," premiering Monday, June 2nd at 10p.m. ET/PT. Actress Haylie Duff ("7th Heaven," Hairspray on Broadway and Napoleon Dynamite) stars in and executive produces alongside Reveille, the eight-episode series which will provide an authentic first-hand look at what it takes to star in a Broadway musical. Viewers will follow 10 "triple-threat" hopefuls as they vie for the ultimate shot at stardom: the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to star on Broadway at the Palace Theatre and replace the Tony Award nominated Laura Bell Bundy in the leading role of "Elle Woods" in Legally Blonde The Musical, which is based on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Picture's (MGM) hit film "Legally Blonde."

For a movie that is out in seven weeks and two days, the fact that they don't even have a trailer (or poster, for that matter) is both worrying and typical. Word on the Oscar blogosphere is that The Reader is far from being complete and that the Weinsteins are just being greedy and now that their partnership with MGM has come to an end I wonder how they are ever going to market this movie. They do realise, don't they, that in order to get people to see your film you must release a poster and a trailer and actually market it. Or are they taking cues from the Australian film industry? Oy....
Lewis testified that US urged silence on Merrill deal-WSJBank of America Corp (BAC.N: Quote, Profile, Research) Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis testified under oath that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pressured the bank to not discuss its plan to buy Merrill Lynch & Co, the Wall Street Journal said. In a testimony before New York's attorney general Andrew Cuomo in February, Lewis told prosecutors that he believed Paulson and Bernanke were instructing him to keep silent about deepening financial difficulties at Merrill, which BofA acquired in January. Lewis testified that the government wanted him to remain silent while the two sides negotiated government funding to help BofA absorb Merrill and its losses, the paper said, citing transcripts of the testimony. A representative of Cuomo questioned Lewis about his failure to disclose Merrill's fourth-quarter losses, which eventually totaled $15.84 billion, according to the paper.

Mike Huckabee appealed to a truly American "bibles, guns and flags" crowd at the NRA. It brought a tear to my eye:
Speaking to the NRA on Friday, veep hopeful Mike Huckabee's speech was interrupted by a loud noise offstage, to which he responded , "That was Barack Obama, he just tripped off a chair, he's getting ready to speak. Somebody aimed a gun at him and he dove for the floor." Yeah, jokes about people taking shots at Obama are hilarious , at least to the members of the NRA. Asswipe.
Since 9/11, now social activist groups are relegated to the pile of terrorists. If you ask Americans who get their news in snippets from TV or radio about all this spying by the FBI, the Pentagon and the NSA or NASA as the president calls it, they are likely to respond by saying that they don't associate with those activist nutcases so they don't care if civil rights have been violated by the administration. They'd rather give up their civil rights than be violated by "terrorists". They move to gated communities and buy guns for protection. Americans are some of the biggest scaredy cats in the world.
"Bush's unauthorized surveillance, in particular, seems very likely to be ineffective. According to experts with whom I have spoken, Bush's approach is like hunting for the proverbial needle in the haystack. As sophisticated as NSA's data mining equipment may be, it cannot, for example, crack codes it does not recognize. So the terrorist communicating in code may escape detection, even if data mining does reach him.
According to the NY Times, "Foreigners and Lhasa residents who witnessed the violence were stunned by what they saw, and by what they did not see: the police. Riot police officers fled after an initial skirmish and then were often nowhere to be found."

May 25, 2007 - A new court filing reveals sordid details of the government's case against long-time neo-Nazi leader Kevin Alfred Strom, who was charged earlier this year with possession of child pornography, witness tampering and "enticing" a young girl. Strom, 50, was for almost 20 years a deputy to William Pierce, leader of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. After Pierce's death, Strom broke away in 2005 to form his own radical group, National Vanguard. But he was arrested near his Virginia home last January, and National Vanguard had collapsed by late March.

It wasn't a mistake that, in 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney's semi-secret Energy Task Force set itself the "task" of opening up the energy sectors of various Middle Eastern countries to "foreign investment"; or that it scrutinized "a detailed map of Iraq's oil fields, together with the (non-American) oil companies scheduled to develop them"; or that, according to the New Yorker's Jane Mayer, the National Security Council directed its staff "to cooperate fully with the Energy Task Force as it considered the 'melding' of two seemingly unrelated areas of policy: 'the review of operational policies towards rogue states,' such as Iraq, and 'actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields'"; or that the only American troops ordered to guard buildings in Iraq, after Baghdad fell, were sent to the Oil Ministry (and the Interior Ministry, which housed Saddam Hussein's dreaded secret police); or that the first "reconstruction" contract was issued to Cheney's former firm, Halliburton, for "emergency repairs" to those patrimonial oil fields. Once in charge in Baghdad, as sociologist Michael Schwartz has made clear, the administration immediately began guiding recalcitrant Iraqis toward denationalizing and opening up their oil industry, as well as bringing in the big boys.
Cases of Zardari corruption piled up fast during 1993-1996. The government claimed Zardari siphoned $1.5 billion in public money. The New Yorker's Steve Coll looked into more than $54 million allegedly stashed in Swiss bank. Zardari also almost $1 million worth of jewelry through a Swiss bank account and an American Express card. Zardari also took kickbacks from a Dubai gold trader. French military contractor Dassault Aviation agreed to pay Zardari $200 million in exchange for a $4 billion jet fighter deal with Pakistan. He was one of the top five richest men in Pakistan with an estimated net worth of US$1.8 billion (2005). The Zardary with Bhutto built a $50 million "prime minister's residence" on 110 acres on an Islamabad hilltop.

But coming from an administration castigated for its conduct of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, such U.S. criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is controversial. Many NATO officials blame inadequate U.S. troop numbers earlier in the war in part for a Taliban resurgence.

There wasn't a week in the Oakland Raiders' 2007 season where JaMarcus Russell's name wasn't mentioned. It didn't matter if he was in street clothes, suited up on the sidelines or lining up under center.
The Oakland Raiders named James Lofton wide receivers coach on Wednesday. The 2003 Hall of Fame inductee spent the last six seasons in the same position with the San Diego Chargers.
Again, you guys are smart enough to draw your own conclusions lah. But I do agree with him about inviting an ulama (ulama's actually plural in Arabic so in universal grammar this sentence is wrong) to MSLS. It would have been even more interesting to have invited an UMNO imam to debate a PAS imam and more importantly making them answer all our uncensored questions. Then I can ask them questions in Arabic to show off (and maybe suffer public embarassment myself when I realise that I've forgotten all my vocab). ;) Nik Aziz for MSLS III, perhaps?

Here is Heidi Klum and her hotty hubby Seal at the 16th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party. The party was hosted by Jennifer Love Hewitt and was held at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood on Sunday. Heidi is best known for her superstar status and the major beauty that goes along with it, and she just never seems to have a hair out of place, does she? So Heidi had some folks wondering at the Night Before the Oscars party as to why she was carrying around a paper cup all night. Some people thought she was eating take-out soup or something, but it did catch some attention. Heidi later explained it was a gift from Wolfgang Puck, he had given her some of his special salad dressing and she and Seal just couldnât get enough of it. I find it strange that Wolfgang couldnât be bothered to use oh I donât know, Tupperware, for a gift that comes in liquid form. And even stranger that Heidi didnât have *anyone* around to take it off her hands for the night. Toting takeout at the Night Before the Oscars party just seems a little umâ¦strange. No?
Hollywood's usual suspects made their way out to the Pacific Design Center here in West Hollywood, CA last night for the LG Electronics launch of the Scarlet HD TV Series ... which basically means -- free booze, free food and kickass giftbags. Here are a few pics from the red carpet:

HE WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY. SUELO graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in anthropology, he thought about becoming a doctor, he held jobs, he had cash and a bank account. In 1987, after several years as an assistant lab technician in Colorado hospitals, he joined the Peace Corps and was posted to an Ecuadoran village high in the Andes. He was charged with monitoring the health of tribespeople in the area, teaching first aid and nutrition, and handing out medicine where needed; his proudest achievement was delivering three babies. The tribe had been getting richer for a decade, and during the two years he was there he watched as the villagers began to adopt the economics of modernity. They sold the food from their fields-quinoa, potatoes, corn, lentils-for cash, which they used to purchase things they didn't need, as Suelo describes it. They bought soda and white flour and refined sugar and noodles and big bags of MSG to flavor the starchy meals. They bought TVs. The more they spent, says Suelo, the more their health declined. He could measure the deterioration on his charts. "It looked," he says, "like money was impoverishing them."

Another extensive survey conducted in 2007 by the Pew Research Center found that 65% of Americans termed themselves "satisfied" with their lives. That compares with the four economic powerhouses of Britain, France, Germany and Italy, which averaged about 53%.
Forty one percent of registered voters told the latest Pew Research Center survey that they disliked the idea of Mr. Clinton back at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, which could happen if his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is elected president. In October, 34 percent of voters disliked the idea.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier this week urged industry to desist from laying off people and promised to cut interest rates and levies to shore up the economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already turned its attention to driving up growth from containing inflation, and cut key reserve ratios for banks and a short-term interest rate, signalling a bias in favour of lower rates.
In January, the Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady, citing the pressures from rising inflation. "The inflation numbers vindicate the judgment call taken in the previous policy. The bank has judiciously given more importance to tackling inflation than spurring growth," commented Pan.

The Swaziland Progressive Party (SPP), under the leadership of John Nquku, was founded in 1960. Itâs manifesto had four points: democratic enfranchisement for all persons irrespective of race, colour, or creed, opposition to the incorporation of Swaziland by South Africa; adoption of the United Nations declaration of human rights; and complete integration to eliminate racial discrimination. Due to questions about Nquku's leadership that party splintered and eventually another party, the Ngwane National Libratory Congress (NNLC) was formed in 1963. Around this same time two other but much less significant parties also were born - the Swaziland Democratic Party (SDP) and the Mbandzeni National Convention (MNC).
You know I don't think Jake is at SXSW. I really think we would have heard something about him being there either in the press for Crawford's premiere or on a blog from the fest. My feeling is that he and Chris went to Brooklyn. Maggie/Naomi/Romana could have been back in the city by the time the weekend was over and the paps don't usually go out there. Would be nice to think he has been visiting with his family and maybe Michelle and Matilda. I also think he had gone back to LA already we would have seen at least a pic or two of him. Just a thought..

WHAT would Taslima Nasrin or Ayaan Hirsi Ali do without the aid Islamists, the Sangh Parivar of India and the Islamophobes of the West provide for their livelihood and their various International awards and monetary grants? Though she hails from a middle-class Somali family, Hirsi Ali has made a career out of picturing her society as a 'moral and intellectual wasteland that is traditional Islam'. Similarly, self-publicist Taslima travels with the baggage sticker of Bangladesh being a country where she is persecuted by Islamic fundamentalists and where all her books are banned. Ever since 1993 I have written many times (which have been on record in published works) against banning books by Taslima in Bangladesh. Book banning is a reprehensible practice on the part of a state that has a modicum of democratic pretension. Having caved in to every single whimsical and politically motivated demand of the Islamists, all the government spin about Bangladesh being a 'moderate' Muslim country seems to be a cruel joke! To be able to speak one's mind is his/her citizen's rights issue. And I would uphold these rights by all means. Whether or not we make the purely hypothetical assumption that Taslima has a mind is another issue altogether. The stupid, culturally ignorant things she said about the Qur'an (such as, it needing corrections, as though ills of society like abuse of women will disappear with the removal of Qur'anic verses that Taslima had read in bad Bangla translations) have been largely ignored by the intelligentsia at first. Even after the serious death threats from the Islamist thugs the public supported her freedom of speech. Sensible people from all walks of life stood by Taslima while disagreeing with her comments on Islam. She has never had the decency to thank them publicly, then or ever, the ingrate that she is. All she mumbles about is how she is against fundamentalism and superstition. Salman Rushdie had the intelligence to point out that the dozen or so demonstrators in Mumbai that showed up to protest his visit in January, 2008, did not represent Indian Muslims. Despite the brouhaha, The Satanic Verses is really a pro-Indian Muslim novel. Muslim intellectuals from various parts of the world, especially those from the subcontinent, who had actually read the English language novel, supported Rushdie during those awful days following the Iranian 'fatwa'. Some of these Muslim writers should be applauded for their moral courage, because they supported Rushdie at the risk of their own lives in their respective countries. I have a long article praising the Rushdie novel published in a book called Law and Literature Perspectives (1996). It makes me cringe whenever Taslima's name is taken in the same breath with Rushdie's. A prominent Bangladeshi Islamist ideologue has, in fact, written that Taslima is OK, meaning she does not pose a threat to the progress of the long-term goal of the Muslim ummah of the Wahhabis taking over Bangladesh. She does not give a fig whether they do or not. Serious Islamists detest Rushdie intensely. He is a cultured person, one of the greatest novelists of our times in any language, and a bit too knowledgeable about Islam. He even studied Islamic history at Cambridge University. Also, it is people like Farida Majid who are pesky and problematic, clamouring against, and deconstructing the dirty politics of 'hijabization' of Muslim women. I have no hope of gathering prestigious awards from anti-Islamic fanatics in the West though, unless I can devise some dumb things to say against the Prophet and hurl uncivilized insults at Islam. Mike Ghouse, a progressive Indian Muslim activist residing in Texas, US, referred to a similar reaction in India when right wing Hindu groups kept taunting about the silence of moderate Muslims supporting Taslima: 'I know several Muslims who want to leave her alone, but she is a tool for the other extremists to play with. Neither side is honest about their care and concern for her.' Among 'other extremists' are the boorish, culturally insensitive self-proclaimed Deshi secularists whose only 'liberal' credentials are displayed through their blatant Islam-bashing. Counted among these are the Hindu fundamentalists from Bangladesh who regularly showed up at street rallies in New York City on behalf of BJP/ Sangh Parivar waving placards proclaiming atrocities against the Hindus in Bangladesh. It is rumoured that in 1992 Taslima was met personally by Lal Krishna Advani, the BJP leader, and was paid handsomely to write her book Lajja, a waif of a novelette depicting repression of Hindus in Bangladesh. Circumstantial evidences are mounting up in support of such a rumour. In 1992-93, in the aftermath of the Babri masjid debacle, I was deeply involved in anti-communalism and anti-fundamentalism activities along with my Indian friends in New York City. Through a potent, popular 'andolon' under the leadership of the late Mrs Jahanara Imam, the mother of a martyred young freedom-fighter of 1971, we raised the demand for trial of the war criminals of 1971 in Bangladesh. There was overwhelming response from the general masses, and the Jamaati honchos and the collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces during the war of independence were cornered in popular opinion and refreshed recollections of 1971. The Jamaati political hoodlums picked up her silly remarks in 1993 and started a riot in Sylhet that quickly spread countrywide. A few members of the public were inadvertently dragged in the melee, but members of religious schools and respectable alems of Bangladesh did not take part in these political unrests. It was the weak-kneed government that balked under the political pressure of the Islamists, and poor Taslima was whisked out of the country by the Swedish embassy. The Taslima incident was just the spark the Islamists needed then to reignite their fundamentalist fire. The main actors and directors of these public theatricals were the war criminals of 1971. The nation has not been able to put the genie back into the bottle from that day to this. No, I will never forgive Taslima for her self indulgence in self-propaganda at the cost of the well-being of a polity. It is patently obvious that she is no more a feminist than the Jamaatis are followers of the true spirit of Islam. The Islamists of Bangladesh have become politically bolder than they were in 1993, thanks to Taslima's intervention in the path of their trial. Today, in an atmosphere of renewed public demand to try the war criminals of 1971, they could conceivably let go a chance to stage another theatrical demanding Taslima's public hanging. And, from the unceremonious departure from India, it looks like Taslima's usefulness to Narendra Modi of Gujarat and his political allies, as an instigator of persecution of Muslim minority in India, may have run out. This is a good time to exorcise the curse of Taslima on the House of Bangladesh. Only one small action is needed. This action is small and inexpensive compared to the initiation of trial of the war criminals at a special tribunal. Both actions can only be taken by the government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Lift the official ban off Taslima's books! And do it now, and do it without a fanfare. The state cannot be seen to bend at the bidding of those very criminals against whom it is expected to press charges of committing crimes against humanity.

Reminder: The SAG awards are on tonight on TNT.
It all began in January when The Closer star Kyra Sedgwick forced TNT to give her $250,000 per episode of her top-rated cable series. When the news of her pay rise hit trade press, actresses across Hollywood asked themselves: "If Kyra can make so much money, why can't I?"
TNT is airing The Patriot in the U.S. So I will watch Gabriel Maritn fight the Brits, but I will not watch it to the end. I can't.
Tonight we'll be watching reruns of Law & Order on TNT. If it's a good night, they start at 7PM and run until 11PM, although I'll be asleep by the time the 10PM episode starts, but DON'T YOU DARE change the channel or turn the tv off! On sucky nights, TNT has basketball or some crap, in which case we'll spend the evening flipping between Discovery, History and the 30 movie channels I pay for. And YES, I am perfectly capable of following the plots of ten different shows on ten different channels simultaneously . Why, aren't YOU?

Joyim for Goyim Miliband, Mild Mel and the Joys of Judeocracy Luke O'Farrell "We propose that it be made an offence to download material from the internet that could incite racial or religious hatred." When it was claimed that the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) made that sinister, totalitarian proposal in September 2006, you could understand what George W. Bush meant when he said: "They hate us for our freedoms." Staunch in defense of freedom, Britain's conservative commentariat rushed to condemn the MCB. "Free speech is the bedrock of a free society!" they thundered. "Any group that seeks to undermine it has no place in a democracy. If Muslims don't like Britain's proud, centuries-old tradition of free speech, they know what they can do: get out!" Shamefully, however, many defenders of Western freedom against Islamist tyranny seem to have forgotten what the MCB said in 2006. If you're one of them, here's an extract from The Times to refresh your memory: The All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism was set up last year. None of the 14 members of the panel is Jewish, but evidence was taken from across the Jewish community. The report proposes that it be made an offence to download material from the internet that could incite racial or religious hatred. Â Drawing on the view of the Macpherson report that a racist act is defined by its victim, not by whether a perpetrator considers himself racist, anti-Semitism is defined in the report as "any remark, insult or act, the purpose or effect of which is to violate a Jewish person's dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him". (Loc. cit., 7th September 2006) Oh dear, so it wasn't the MCB who wanted to turn us into a police-state after all: it was the philosemitic politicians who conducted the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism. Whoever would have guessed it? Anyone who knows about Jews and free speech, that's who. Â If Jews have power and influence, they start working to take away free speech. It's no use arguing that some Jews support free speech and some white goyim oppose it: the average effect of the two groups is perfectly clear. It was whites who created free speech in the West and it is Jews who are taking it away. Was there any popular support for Britain's race laws, introduced in the 1960s and steadily harshened ever since? No, there wasn't, but what does the will of the people matter in a democracy? The Board of Jewish Deputies wanted the race laws and got them. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League would like identical laws in the United States; so far, thanks to the evil white males who created the First Amendment, it hasn't gotten them. Â Canadians haven't been so lucky, as the neo-con Mark Steyn has discovered. He's gotten into trouble for saying things Muslims don't like, but let's give him his due: he's admitted that Jews aren't entirely blameless: Submission from the Board of Deputies of British Jews The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomes the opportunity to make this submission to the Select Committee on Religious Offences. The Board is the representative body and voice of the British Jewish community. It was founded in 1760. The Jewish community is covered by the provisions of the Race Relations Acts. The Board is generally satisfied with the format of the current legislation following the amendments to Part 3 of the Public Order Act in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. The Malicious Communications Act 1998 and its subsequent amendment offer further protection. Together these have removed the legal and linguistic barriers which previously had hampered prosecutions. The UK is now faced with a growth in inter-religious friction, sparked in large measure by conflict in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. This has led to the dissemination of propaganda deliberately attacking Jews qua Jews by Muslims. The Sikh and Hindu communities have similarly been targeted. We are in touch with representative bodies within these communities and can provide examples of such incitement. The Board of Deputies welcomes the proposal to introduce new laws to combat incitement to religious hatred, but notes that this must be matched by the political will to prosecute offenders. Otherwise any new powers risk becoming as ineffective as the existing laws against incitement to racial hatred. "It's not enough, already! Ve vont more laws! No free speech for ze vicked goyim!" And Mark Steyn isn't tackling another vital question: that of how Muslims got into the West in such large numbers to join the Jew-initiated, Jew-continued assault on free speech. Was there any popular support for mass immigration by Muslims in Britain, for example? No, there wasn't: there was massive popular opposition. But what does the will of the people matter in a democracy? Britain is run for the benefit of those who fund its political parties: men like "Lord" Levy, his pals from Jewish Care, and David Abrahams, whose excuse for conspiring to make secret payments to New Labour was that he wanted to avoid the appearance of "a Jewish conspiracy". That's what democracy means in Britain: Jews pay, pols obey. Want thought crime laws? You got 'em! Want mass immigration? You got it! Want war in Iraq? You got that too!

The European Union's response to Mr Hill in retrospect however stands to reason as well as being correct in saying that "how the code is implemented is up to each member country. The Slovakian Economy Ministry denies that the sale is in violation of the code where emphatically the Ministry spokesman Branislav Zvara has said that "the UN Security Council's evaluation of the situation in Sri Lanka has not led it to declare an embargo on arms shipments to the country" and perhaps reason enough for Mr Hill to put up something more plausible or shut up!

Pentagon health experts are urging Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ban the use of tobacco by troops and end its sale on military property, a change that could dramatically alter a culture intertwined with smoking. Jack Smith, head of the Pentagon's office of clinical and program policy, says he will recommend that Gates adopt proposals by a federal study that cites rising tobacco use and higher costs for the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs as reasons for the ban. The study by the Institute of Medicine, requested by the VA and Pentagon, calls for a phased-in ban over a period of years, perhaps up to 20. "We'll certainly be taking that recommendation forward," Smith says. A tobacco ban would confront a military culture, the report says, in which "the image of the battle-weary soldier in fatigues and helmet, fighting for his country, has frequently included his lit cigarette." Also, the report said, troops worn out by repeated deployments often rely on cigarettes as a "stress reliever." The study found that tobacco use in the military increased after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began.

Low-cost disfavored Chinese labor is utilized by corporate america to maximize margins. They all do it. Only WalMart gets fingered because they are the ones who help, and those who seek to create confusion in the marketplace want to eliminate the vast middle class who have a real chance and instead stick with lower classes who may not work otherwise. So they dirty him up while allowing the others to appear clean.

The KLA has been credibly linked to Al Qaeda leader Osama Binladen. In 1998, Fatos Klosi, the head of SHIK (Albania's intelligence service), told London's Sunday Times newspaper that Binladen had visited Albania to send units to fight in Kosovo. In 1999, the Washington Times reported that it had obtained intelligence documents that showed a &quot;link&quot; between Binladen and the KLA--including a common staging area in Tropoje, Albania, a center for Islamic terrorists.
For the last two years, scientists were predicting high hurricane activity in the United States. Yet, according to David Demming, writing in the Washington Times last year, "...neither the intensity nor the frequency of hurricanes has increased." The article points out that "the 2007 season was the third-quietest since 1966," and that "in 2006 not a single hurricane made landfall in the U.S."
"I'm not going to address that," said Mr. Jackson, when asked by The Washington Times whether he agrees with the sentiments of Wright's Chicago-based church, which accused the media < http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9062.html >of subjecting the pastor to "crucifixion." "Frankly, I'm not going to buy into the hype."
The NAACP filed lawsuits Friday against two of the nation's largest mortgage lenders -- HSBC and Wells Fargo -- alleging "systematic, institutionalized racism" in their subprime lending. NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous says, "We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem." We have targeted these banks because we have gone through what we can get our hands on, and it seems like there's a real problem here," NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous told CNN. Jealous said the group wants "transparency." "We want to see the books," he added. "We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem." [snip] Under subprime lending, people who don't qualify for lower interest rates can borrow money at higher rates. The NAACP argues that the companies gave subprime rates to African-Americans who qualified for better rates and gave better rates to white customers with similar credit histories.
God, when I had to get my license renewed when I turned 18 last year, I just about flipped my shit at the DPS because the one I went to (on N Lamar) didn't have a price sign posted (like they do in Corpus Christi, where I got my first two licenses). I could have SWORN the cost was $26, and I only had $25 in cash and had left my checkbook at my dorm, and, as you well know, they don't take credit/debit cards. I spent AN HOUR driving around looking for a friggin' Wells Fargo ATM, before I remembered that I had a spare checkbook (one of my replacements) in my trunk.

2,728 Bangladeshi peacekeepers decorated with UN Medal UNB, Dhaka A total of 2,728 peacekeepers from Bangladesh have been decorated with the United Nations Medal after serving for more than six months in Ivory Coast. The Force Commander of the UN Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI), General Marcel Fernand Amoussou, presided over the medal ceremony honoring the Bangladeshi contingent in Daloa, 380kms from Abidjan, on March 26, said a UN Information Centre release in Dhaka on Sunday. Speaking on the occasion, Brig Gen Mustafa Kamal Khan, the commander of UNOCI's sector West, expressed his pride on behalf of the Bangladeshi soldiers in receiving the medal on the day commemorating Bangladesh's declaration of Independence. Bangladesh first entered the family of "Blue Helmets" in 1988 and, since then, has provided more than 60,000 soldiers. There are currently more than 9,600 Bangladeshi soldiers and police operating in 11 different peacekeeping operations, making Bangladesh among the top providers of uniformed personnel to the UN. Bangladesh has provided one-third of the troop strength in ONUCI.
Ivory Coast has been taken off the list of offenders altogether because of actions it has taken, including the release to UNICEF of about 3,000 child fighters.

The Czech Republic will offer a free plane ticket and 500 euros ($649) to foreign workers who voluntarily agree to return home after losing their jobs in the economic downturn, the government said on Monday. The sweeteners are among measures to cope with security risks stemming from rising unemployment among foreign workers in the EU member country, Interior Minister Ivan Langer said. In the past years, the fast-growing Czech economy, led by the car industry, lured cheap labor mainly from Ukraine, Slovakia, Vietnam, Mongolia and Moldova. Langer said many unemployed foreigners lacked cash to pay for a ticket home, as they had been saving to pay excessive fees or bribes -- up to $12,000 -- to agencies that secured them jobs in the Czech Republic.

Furthermore, the emails show the Bush-Cheney campaign and RNC staffers compiled voter-challenge lists that targeted probable Democratic voters in at least five states: New Mexico, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Voting rights lawyers have made allegations of so called "vote caging," against Republicans previously. These emails provide more evidence. One Republican operative involved in the planning wrote "we can do this in NV, FL, PA and NM because we have a list to run against the Absentee Ballot requests, and should."
-Toledo, Ohio has become the first major city in the state to offer domestic partners benefits. Both same-sex and unmarried couples who prove they cohabitate, have intermingled finances, and are over 18 years-old can register to receive the same city benefits as married couples. Registering with the city also serves as proof of the relationship to non-city employees whose employers offer similar benefits. Toledo's ordinance is based on similar rules in Cleveland Heights.

I know AnneMarie is compiling a list of free things to do and some of us have been talking about having a weekly park schedule. I love that big playground at GG Park. They just don't make parks like that anymore! Last week Hannah and I went down to San Jose to visit a friend and we went to a place called Happy Hollow. It is a very small zoo with some rides and playgrounds. We tried riding one of their carousels and Hannah freaked out. They actually stopped the ride so we could get off. She much preferred watching to riding ;). We will have to try riding on just a bench seat at GG Park. If we feel up for it a trip to Happy Hollow this summer would be fun. Those with zoo memberships get in at 1/2 price (I don't even know what it costs). Just an idea to add to the list.

The Politico's Ben Smith outlines several possible reasons for this, among them racial and cultural politics following the scandals over Obama's pastor and the infamous "bitter comment." Counties with universities remained Obama strongholds, pointing to a possible student/non-student divide.

I'm not saying McCain is a &quot;winner&quot; in the Hail-to-the-Chief sense, I'm just saying right now he's most likely to wind up with the nomination. This is beginning to feel like a thriller with tons of wild plot twists but a disappointing finale. Imagine 1996 with exciting car chases round hairpin bends but you still wind up with Bob Dole.
When the Missing Service Personnel Act of 1996 came on the Senate Floor for debate, Senator McCain called this bill "un-necessary" and "burdensome" even though the MSPA was sponsored by the then majority leader and the man who had considered asking John McCain to run with him, Sen. Bob Dole.
In 2003 nearly half of all Americans falsely assumed that the U.S. government had found solid evidence for a link between Iraq and al Qaeda. What is more, almost a quarter of us believed that investigators had all but confirmed the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, according to a 2003 report by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and Knowledge Networks, a polling and market research firm. How did the true situation in Iraq become so grossly distorted in American minds? Many people have attributed such misconceptions to a politically motivated disinformation campaign to engender support for the armed struggle in Iraq. We do not think the deceptions were premeditated, however. Instead they are most likely the result of common types of reasoning errors, which appear frequently in discussions in the news media and which can easily fool an unsuspecting public. News shows often have an implicit bias that may motivate the portrayal of facts and opinions in misleading ways, even if the information presented is largely accurate. Nevertheless, by becoming familiar with how spokespeople can create false impressions, media consumers can learn to ignore certain claims and thereby avoid getting duped. We have detected two general types of fallacies-one of them well known and the other newly identified-that have permeated discussion of the Iraq War and that are generally ubiquitous in political debates and other discourse. Spinning Straw into Fool's Gold One common method of spinning information is the so-called straw man argument. In this tactic, a person summarizes the opposition's position inaccurately so as to weaken it and then refutes that inaccurate rendition. In a November 2005 speech, for example, President George W. Bush responded to questions about pulling troops out of Iraq by saying, "We've heard some people say, pull them out right now. That's a huge mistake. It'd be a terrible mistake. It sends a bad message to our troops, and it sends a bad message to our enemy, and it sends a bad message to the Iraqis." The statement that unnamed "people" are advocating a troop withdrawal from Iraq "right now" is a straw man, because it exaggerates the opposing viewpoint. Not even the most stalwart Bush adversaries backed an immediate troop withdrawal. Most proposed that the soldiers be sent home over several months, a more reasonable and persuasive plan that Bush undercut with his straw man. The straw man is used in countless other contexts as well. In his acceptance speech at the 1996 Democratic Convention, for instance, Bill Clinton opined: ". with all respect [to Bob Dole], we do not need to build a bridge to the past. We need to build a bridge to the future." Dole did discuss restoring the values of an earlier America, but Clinton falsely implied that Dole was only looking backward (whereas Clinton was looking forward). People may use a straw man to discredit theories to which they do not subscribe. Characterizing evolution, for example, as "all random chance" is a straw man argument; it misrepresents a complex theory that only partly rests on the randomness of mutations that may lead to better chances of survival. Recently, in a 2006 paper co-authored with Scott F. Aikin, one of us (Talisse) documented a twist on the straw man tactic. In what Talisse dubs a weak man argument, a person sets up the opposition's weakest (or one of its weakest) arguments or proponents for attack, as opposed to misstating a rival's position as the straw man argument does. In a July 2007 edition of Talking Points, Bill O'Reilly took on a claim by the New York Times that we had lost the war in Iraq by saying that Â "the New York Times declared defeat in Iraq Sunday on its editorial page, and there's no question the antiwar movement has momentum." (The editorial actually said that "some opponents of the Iraq war are toying with the idea of American defeat," but let us assume that O'Reilly's characterization was correct.) O'Reilly then offered a weak man explanation for the purported defeat: Â "The truth is the Iraqi government and many of its citizens are simply not doing enough to defeat the terrorists and corruption. The U.S.A. can't control that country. No nation could.... Unfortunately, the Iraqi failure to help themselves has come true." Although Iraq's failure to aid in fighting terrorism and corruption could be why we are losing the war, the troubles in Iraq could also stem from a host of logistical reasons, some of which may shed a negative light on the current administration. O'Reilly, however, kept any discussion of these reasons offstage, suppressing the various other possible-and possibly more likely-reasons for "defeat" in Iraq. Meanwhile his claims that the "U.S.A. can't control that country" and that "no nation could" deflected blame from the U.S. government. Weak man arguments are pervasive. In a 2005 editorial in Denver's Rocky Mountain News, conservative writer and activist David Horowitz picked on ethnic studies scholar Ward Churchill, formerly at the University of Colorado at Boulder, whose views he described as "hateful and ignorant." Horowitz then went on to claim that Churchill's radical "hate America" convictions Â "represent" those of a "substantial segÂ­ment of the academic community." Thus, he used the example of Churchill (the weak man) to argue that "tenured radicals" have made universities into leftist political institutions and subverted the academic enterprise, thereby failing to acknowledge the presence of more highly regarded and politically mainstream scholars in academia. Trolling for Truth Weak man tactics are harder to detect than those of the straw man variety. Because straw man arguments are closely related to an opponent's true position, a clever listener might be able to spot the truth amid the hyperbole, understatement or other corrupted version of that view. A weak man argument, however, is more opaque because it contains a grain of truth and often bears little similarity to the stronger arguments that should also be presented. Therefore, a listener has to know a lot more about the situation to imagine the information that a speaker or writer has cleverly disregarded. Nevertheless, an astute consumer of the news can catch many straw man and weak man fallacies by knowing how they work. Another strategy is to always consider a speaker's or writer's motivation or agenda and be especially alert for skewed statements of fact in editorials, television opinion shows, and the like. It is also wise to obtain news from more balanced news sources. An alternative approach is to try to construct, in your own mind, the best argument against what you have heard before accepting it as true. Or simply ask yourself: Why should I not believe this?
John McCain is Bob Dole minus the charm, conservatism and youth. Like McCain, pollsters assured us that Dole was the most "electable" Republican. Unlike McCain, Dole didn't lie all the time while claiming to engage in Straight Talk. Of course, I might lie constantly too, if I were seeking the Republican presidential nomination after enthusiastically promoting amnesty for illegal aliens, Social Security credit for illegal aliens, criminal trials for terrorists, stem-cell research on human embryos, crackpot global warming legislation and free speech-crushing campaign-finance laws. I might lie too, if I had opposed the Bush tax cuts, a marriage amendment to the Constitution, waterboarding terrorists and drilling in Alaska. And I might lie if I had called the ads of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth "dishonest and dishonorable." McCain angrily denounces the suggestion that his "comprehensive immigration reform" constituted "amnesty" â on the ludicrous grounds that it included a small fine. Even the guy who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy didn't fall for this a few years ago. In 2003, McCain told the Tucson Citizen that "amnesty has to be an important part" of any immigration reform. He also rolled out the old chestnut about America's need for illegals, who do "jobs that American workers simply won't do." McCain's amnesty bill would have immediately granted millions of newly legalized immigrants Social Security benefits. He even supported allowing work performed as an illegal to count toward Social Security benefits as recently as a vote in 2006 â now adamantly denied by Mr. Straight Talk. McCain keeps boasting that he was "the only one" of the Republican presidential candidates who supported the surge in Iraq. What is he talking about? All Republicans supported the surge â including Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani. The only ones who didn't support it were McCain pals like Sen. Chuck Hagel. Indeed, the surge is the first part of the war on terrorism that caused McCain to break from Hagel in order to support the president. True, McCain voted for the war. So did Hillary Clinton. Like her, he then immediately started attacking every other aspect of the war on terrorism. (The only difference was he threw in frequent references to his experience as a POW, which currently outnumber John Kerry's references to being a Vietnam vet.) Thus, McCain joined with the Democrats in demanding O.J. trials for terrorists at Guantanamo, including his demand that the terrorists have full access to the intelligence files being used to prosecute them. These days, McCain gives swashbuckling speeches about the terrorists who "will follow us home." But he still opposes dripping water down their noses. He was a POW, you know â and also a member of the Keating 5 scandal, which you probably don't know, and won't â until he becomes the Republican nominee. Though McCain was far from the only Republican to support the surge, he does have the distinction of being the only Republican who voted against the Bush tax cuts. (Also the little lamented Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who later left the Republican Party.) Now McCain claims he opposed the tax cuts because they didn't include enough spending cuts. But that wasn't what he said at the time. To the contrary, in 2001, McCain said he was voting against Bush's tax cuts based on the idiotic talking point of the Democrats. "I cannot in good conscience," McCain said, "support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief." McCain started and fanned the vicious anti-Bush myth that, before the 2000 South Carolina primary, the Bush campaign made phone calls to voters calling McCain a "liar, cheat and a fraud" and accusing him of having an illegitimate black child. On the thin reed of a hearsay account, McCain immediately blamed the calls on Bush. "I'm calling on my good friend George Bush," McCain said, "to stop this now. He comes from a better family. He knows better than this." Bush denied that his campaign had anything to do with the alleged calls and, in a stunningly magnanimous act, ordered his campaign to release the script of the calls being made in South Carolina. Bush asked McCain to do the same for his calls implying that Bush was an anti-Catholic bigot, but McCain refused. Instead, McCain responded with a campaign commercial calling Bush a liar on the order of Bill Clinton:
I just mentioned this GSN programming block in another post, and it leads me to ask a question.

Bobby Fischer, 64, chess master.
NBC's Brian Williams, moderator of the 90-minute event, pointed out that in recent years, no Republican has won the party's presidential nomination without first winning the Florida primary.
NBC's Brian Williams took to MSNBC today at noon and had this to say:
The Drudge Report's link to the YouTube iteration of the CBS News piece transformed it into a cultural phenomenon reaching far beyond a third-place network news program's nightly audience. It had more YouTube views than the inflammatory Wright sermons, more than even the promotional video of Britney Spears making her latest "comeback" on a TV sitcom. It was as this digital avalanche crashed down that Mrs. Clinton, backed into a corner, started offering the alibi of "sleep deprivation" and then tried to reignite the racial fires around Mr. Wright.
It's why Bruce Campbell has never had a proper career or why Troma films are always bad. They trade on "cult", but the audience for cult - by pure definition - is too small and to scream to everyone that your film is "destined for cult status" is to all but say "this film is destined to be watched on late night cable TV by people who read AICN!" It's a shame though because French Kissers looks better than that and while Lyndon was right in saying that "We can safely assume FRENCHKISSERS is not going to be m-stream hit in Oz," it's still a bad marketing method in my eyes. Why ally yourself with a word associated with failure?
MARK! STOP IT!: Ugh! Mark Ruffalo is on the cover of "Mean Magazine", a magazine that apparently comes out wherever people randomly feel like it. I almost bought this issue because there's an article about Anna Faris and Bruce Campbell. But I was too ashamed.
Bottom Line: The battle sequences and the Sandman effects are worth the price of admission but prepare yourself for "dramatic" scenes that will bore you senseless. Bruce Campbell is a god among insects. Or arachnids. His scene brought the house down.

Well, if the CIA, the intelligence arm of the United States, which touted itself as citadel of democracy, before the George W Bush era began in 2000, can practice waterboarding, why won't our TID?
The Presidency of George W Bush saw some of the most defining moments in contemporary history. One would expect him to have gone down in quotations books on subjects like war and the economy. Surprisingly, what George W Bush is most quoted for is his famous slip-of-the-tongue. This page is a top 10 list of George Bush quotes, or Bushisms as they are popularly called.
I have seen the LIEberals counting down the days to the end of George W Bush's administration and it sounded vaguely familiar.

In recent times, the high profile visits of Foreign Secretary David Miliband and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith have only underlined the assertive diplomacy Choudhury has epitomised as High Commissioner here. Besides, the recent Downing Street meeting between Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has added to Choudhury's credibility as a man able to produce results.

Jake doesn't seem so happy with comparisons between his own role in Moonlight Mile and the young Dustin Hoffman's in The Graduate, although his high regard and respect for Dustin is pretty clear: 'Hoffman's also in the room, being interviewed at another table. Gyllenhaal, who beams in Hoffman's presence, shouts across the room to his co-star: "She says I remind her of you!" "You're taller, you're better-looking, and when I played your character, I was 10 years older," Hoffman shoots back, without missing a beat.' And it was with the encouragement of Dustin, that Jake took to the boards of the West End.

She stated in her official MySpace profile that R&B vocalist Bilal is among the collaborators on the album, but what she didn't mention is that hitmaker Swizz Beatz is also on board as he produced a new track for her called "Pretty Good", and I'm really hoping that this joint will make it to the final cut! For those who came in late, Knowles also worked with Kaseem Dean as a songwriter on her sister Beyonce's smash singles "Upgrade U" and "Get Me Bodied". Also look out for more Swizzy productions on the next albums by Britney Spears, Usher, Jennifer Lopez and rapper Eve.

Lester Brown (Plan B; 1.0. 2.0, 3.0) has an interesting article doing the rounds in the green blogosphere in which he outlines the tough year that coal has had in the US. The same will be true if it tries some kind of resurgence here in the UK. I`m certainly going to do what i can in resisting such an appauling idea. The progress made so far in the US, if it holds, could set a major precident for coal in the developed world; and moves the whole world towards a situations where coal without ccs comes to be seen in the right manner, namely hugely irresponsible, and just not something that is the done thing. We will have to set this example and help provide alternatives in the growing Asian giants are to avoid this environmentally costly and dangerously polluting form of power. - Story on Celsias - Story on Treehugger More on coal:

I'm a reporter. I meet with people and I talk to them. Then based on a review of all of the facts, I report closet cases that hurt the gay community. You may not like my style, but I have a track record of 100%. And for those reasons I am now able to confirm a rumor that has circulated in South Carolina for years. South Carolina Lt. Governor Andre Bauer is a closeted anti-gay politician who stands to replace Mark Sanford should Sanford resign or be impeached (a real possibility as Sanford is caught in his own sex scandal.)

More details -- including the bewilderingly defined geographical area within which pies may be called MELTON MOWBRAY - can be found here.Meanwhile, the IPKat thanks Chris Ellins (University of Westminster, London) for this link to the saga of the heirs of the late actor Steve McQueen, who have gone to a Manhattan court to stop an apparel manufacturer from using his name and likeness to promote its products without their consent.The heirs, through the Chadwick McQueen and The Terry McQueen Testamentary Trust, object to an alleged "rip-off" by Belstaff USA Corp., seeking injunctive relief to stop the company selling jackets, coats, sweaters, T-shirts, pants and shoes bearing McQueen's name. Belstaff's response is here; pictures and background (including a picture of the lining to the contested jacket referring to Steve McQueen) here.Left: Steve McQueen, posing for and Abercrombie & Fitch advertisement ...Never one to be forgotten, the IPKat's friend Miri Frankel (a Beanstalk person from across the Pond), has been telling him all about Woody Allen's attempt to strip another clothing company that is better known for what its models don't wear than what they do -- American Apparel -- of at least US$10 million for using his image on billboards and on the internet.Right: if they can't use Woody Allen's likeness on their billboards, AA have to resort to something like this ...Allen says he doesn't endorse commercial products or services in the United States, which made American Apparel's billboards in Hollywood and New York and webite displays "especially egregious and damaging".

If I become a non-citizen and an Al Qaeda member, sure.
Al Qaeda was not a fan of his, but they would have used him as a useful apostate.
I've argued that staying in Iraq indefinitely undermines our national security by empowering jihadis -- just as we now know that our military presence in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s was, in fact, counterproductive by empowering Al Qaeda in its early days. On the other hand, supporters of the war argue that a withdrawal from Iraq would signal weakness and leave a vacuum that extremists would fill, and those are legitimate concerns.
A State Department report cited evidence that one of the Jamaat's main allies, the Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami, also headquartered in Pakistan, "maintains contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan."

If Jake gets nominated again for something, I'll want him to win, but I'm not so concerned about awards.

Fresh from BAILII comes a trade mark ruling on Friday from the Chancery Division (England and Wales), from Mr Justice Etherton: D Jacobson & Sons Ltd v Globe GB Ltd and another [2008] EWHC 88 (Ch). Jacobson acquired the GOLA footwear brand and its associated intellectual property rights way back in 1996. Globe sold and imported footwear into the United Kingdom, including shoes known as 'Globe Finale', 'Globe Wedge' and 'Globe Motto'. Globe's shoes featured a stripe design on the sides known as the 'Globe side design' and the word 'globe'. Jacobson sued for infringement of its UK and Community registered trade marks (above, left and right) for its 'Wing Flash' logo in respect of Globe's markings on its trainers (illustrated below, right). Jacobson also alleged that Globe was passing its footwear off as its own, seeking an injunction and the destruction of the offending products. Globe counterclaimed for a declaration that Jacobson registered trade marks were invalid.On the validity issue Globe submitted that the Gola trade marks were invalid because the Wing Flash logo was not a sign capable of distinguishing the goods of its proprietor from those of other undertakings. As to infringement, Globe argued that the side design was not intended to be a mark of origin, but rather mere decoration.Etherton J held for Gola on both issues. In his opinion * Jacobson's marks were inherently distinctive. Taking the evidence as a whole, including evidence of matters post-registration which might throw light on what the attitude of the average consumer had been at the earlier date of registration, the Wing Flash would have been recognised by the average consumer as a distinctive mark of origin of the shoes, distinguishing their provenance from those produced by other manufacturers.* infringement had been established, since the consumer was likely to be confused into believing that Globe's and Jacobson's products came from related undertakings.* Globe was also liable for passing off. Even though there was no evidence of actual loss and damage by reason of the confusion generated by the Globe shoes, the confusion between the two brands put Jacobson's goodwill at risk since it was unable to control Globe's use of its markings.The disturbing thing in this case, says the IPKat, is not the result or the law, but the very large degree to which expert evidence has been deployed. He seems to remember judicial statements -- admittedly going back to the previous century -- to the extent that likelihood of confusion of the relevant consumer was something that the courts should be able to determine for themselves. Did something change in the meantime?
The IPKat credits LexisNexis Butterworths' subscription-only service for digging up Experience Hendrix LLC and another v Times Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWHC 458 (Ch), a decision given yesterday on costs in copyright infringement litigation from Mr Justice Warren of the Chancery Division, England and Wales.Right: Jimi Hendrix's memorial -- a tribute from The Stones?Following protracted proceedings, Experience Hendrix succeeded in obtaining summary judgment in a copyright infringement action against Times Newspapers (you can read the IPKat's account of the earlier proceedings here). Once the main issues had been sorted out, the court ordered delivery up of infringing material, disclosure in the terms of Island Records Ltd v Tring International (to give Hendrix Experience sufficient information to enable it to choose between damages and an account of profits) and costs that were to be paid on an indemnity basis. Subsequently, an offer under the Civil Procedure Rules Part 36 was revisited; this was a cash offer that Times Newspapers had made before the issue of liability was ruled on, together with an undertaking to destroy the master copy and other copies of any recordings within its possession and a promise not to exploit the copies of any recordings it held. In these proceedings Times Newspapers argued that, in light of the Pt 36 offer which they made, the court should not have awarded indemnity costs but, instead, should have ordered that the question of costs be reserved.Warren J was not disposed to accept Times Newspapers' contention. He sumarised the linear nature of most copyright litigation as follows: where the claimant as copyright owner wanted monetary compensation, the first stage was to try to establish infringement. If the claimant won, Island Records-style disclosure would be ordered so that he could elect between his remedies of damages or an account of profits. Until that information had been disclosed, the successful claimant was not in a position to know which to choose. Once that information was given and the claimant opted for damages or an account of profits, the next step was to work out how much the quantum of damages or an account should be.Having said all this, the judge then addressed the key issue of costs. In this case, he said, there was no reason for interfering with the nature of the costs order. Even taking into account the Pt 36 offer, Hendrix Experience would still have had to go to the expense of securing a favourable judgment on the issue of liability in order to proceed to the next stage, being the damages/profits enquiry.The IPKat assumes that the sums in question must have been pretty large in order to make it worth litigating over them like this. Merpel says, I wonder if this is all changed by IP Enforcement Directive 2004/48, which looks as though the successful claimant in infringement proceedings can ask for both compensatory damages and an account of profits.Cat's first guitar lesson hereCat guitarists here and here

The derelict Gowanus Building, an old power station in Brooklyn, has been on sale for $27M forever. It gained the above editorial last September during the Wall Street bailout, which hasn't helped it sell, oddly enough. The building sits on the Gowanus Canal, one of the nation's most polluted waterways. The EPA has proposed adding the Gowanus to its Superfund cleanup priority list, a move opposed by Mayor Bloomberg because that would interfere with two proposed 1200-unit apartment towers.

I can't believe that any real environmentalist would support anyone else." The Nader/Gonzalez campaign has completed its goal of achieving 45 state ballots, and will be a write-in choice in four other states. Mr. Nader and Mr. Gonzalez are pleased to be allying with a party that has initiative, ecological wisdom, and an eye for the future.

Part of my "job" at the real estate office is to help the broker pull credit reports on tenants (mainly because he is not computer literate enough to navigate the on line system). The Smiths somehow managed to get into a rental while their C13 was still in the court system. From what I've heard, they have been stellar tenants with very few hiccups. This past spring, they thought they wanted to move to a different rental. We pulled their credit report for two prospective rentals and boy, were they surprised at the amount of incorrect information on their credit report. A number of accounts resolved in the C13 were still listed as active and past due or in collections, their former home was listed as a foreclosure sale, other loans were listed as past due (even though they had sold a number of the toys that contributed to the C13 Bk-boat, jet ski, 3rd and 4th vehicles). To top it off, all this mis-information resulted in a FICO score is the low 500's for both of them. When Mrs. Smith read her report and saw all this mis-information, she nearly had a meltdown. It also made me run for my credit reports to make sure my information was correct and current (it was not pretty information, but at least it was correct).

A recent pronouncement to exile Green Party Leader, Elizabeth May, from the upcoming leader's debate has left the Green Party wounded. The decision was carried out by Canadian broadcasting companies and was strongly backed by the Conservative party, who stated that Mr. Harper would not show up to the debates if Elizabeth May was included.
China and Russia put the blame on some screwed up experiments of US for the earthquake that happened in Haiti. Chinese and Russian Military scientists, these reports say, are concurring with Canadian researcher, and former Asia-Pacific Bureau Chief of Forbes Magazine, Benjamin Fulford, who in a very disturbing video released from his Japanese offices to the American public, details how the United States attacked China by the firing of a 90 Million Volt Shockwave from the Americans High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facilities in Alaska If we can recollect a previous news when US blamed Russia for the earthquake in Georgio. What do you guys think? Is it really possible to create an earthquake by humans? I came across this [url=http://universalages.com/hot-news/what-happened-in-haiti-is-it-related-to-haarp/]article about Haiti Earthquake[/url] in some blog it seems very interesting, but conspiracy theories have always been there.

And occasionally stupid. Dan Froomkin, writing for washingtonpost.com and echoing a common meme among my critics, asserted< http://voices.washingtonpost.com/white-house-watch/torture/krauthamme... >that "the ticking time bomb scenario only exists in two places: On TV and in the dark fantasies of power-crazed and morally deficient authoritarians." (He later helpfully suggested that my moral deficiencies derived from "watching TV and fantasizing about being Jack Bauer.") On Oct. 9, 1994, Israeli Cpl. Nachshon Waxman was kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists. The Israelis captured the driver of the car. He was interrogated with methods so brutal that they violated Israel's existing 1987 interrogation guidelines, which themselves were revoked in 1999 by the Israeli Supreme Court as unconscionably harsh. The Israeli prime minister who ordered, as we now say, this enhanced interrogation explained without apology: "If we'd been so careful to follow the ('87) Landau Commission (guidelines), we would never have found out where Waxman was being held."
I have yet to find anything addressing nalgene specifically, but I followed links from snopes.com to Johns Hopkins where I found a link to not only their position on the scare but to a Q&A with someone on their faculty who has an extensive list of publications on water and water quality. Is he in the pay of the bisphenol industry? Not that I can see -- and just because he doesn't agree with the risk assessment doesn't automatically mean he's been paid off. See (2) below.

"Bush out," about 1000 demonstrators chanted in the centre of the capital Lima, watched by scores of police in riot gear who made sure they did not move towards the APEC summit venue several kilometres away. "This crisis didn't come from the Peruvian people. We shouldn't have to pay for it," a union leader told the crowd, which demonstrated peacefully. Mr Bush, one of 21 leaders of Asia-Pacific economies converging on Lima for the weekend summit, arrived shortly after the protest. He was escorted under tight US Secret Service and Peruvian police security from Lima airport to the army headquarters building housing the APEC meetings. Friday's anti-Bush protest, organised by Peru's biggest labour union, charged that Mr Bush's decision to wage a costly war in Iraq contributed to the financial and economic crises. "The International Criminal Court should try him for crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression," a big banner next to the main stage for the rally proclaimed. "Bush - genocide. The Peruvians repudiate your crimes," said another. "We believe that Bush is responsible for the fall of the financial system," explained Aldo Gil Cristostomo, a 54-year-old mechanic standing near other protesters carrying portraits of Che Guevara. "The war in Iraq is partly responsible for the fall," he said. Mr Cristostomo added that, while he had more sympathy for Mr Bush's successor, Barack Obama, he believed the Democrat "is going to maintain the neo-liberal system" championed by the current US president. Lima was filled with 39,000 police officers ensuring that none of the heads of state and government would be able to see any demonstrations. At least five people who were among 20 protesters holding a separate against corruption close to the summit venue were arrested late Thursday. The participants had tried to release a number of live rats in a gesture decrying graft in Peruvian public life, the organiser, Fidel Supo, said in a video published on the website of El Comercio newspaper.
Secret Service Looking Into Potential Threat Against Obama http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/10/secret-service-looking-into...
That was a very significant moment at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings with Amb. Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus. Joe Biden asked Amb. Crocker where it would be better for American national security interests to eliminate Al Qaeda in Iraq or Al Qaeda along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Crocker had nowhere to hide with that question. Spencer Ackerman describes the outcome.
No counterparts to the young Kerry at war hearing Thirty-eight years ago today, a soldier fresh from Vietnam riveted the nation by recounting the horrors of a far-away war, famously asking the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: "How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?" The speech by 27-year-old John Kerry launched his rise from antiwar protester to presidential nominee to chairman of that very same powerful committee. Tomorrow Senator Kerry will listen as veterans of the war in Afghanistan shine a spotlight on a conflict that a small but growing number of Americans are beginning to question, even as President Obama increases troops. But in a sign of how much Kerry - and the country - has changed since 1971, tomorrow's hearings will feature few - if any - dramatic calls for withdrawal. Kerry's committee did not invite any witness from the Iraq Veterans Against the War, the modern-day analog of the antiwar group he represented when he testified in 1971. That group, which includes Afghanistan war veterans, has called for an end to the Afghan war. At least three out of the four Afghan war veterans who will testify tomorrow oppose a US withdrawal. >>>>>More

Robert Callahan, the man who is to replace Paul Trivelli as US Ambassador in Managua said that the Nicaraguan government has made unmeasured criticisms against the US and said President "Daniel Ortega and the other national leaders should be more prudent in their use of language and measured in their criticisms. This type of rhetoric can anger and hurt." Callahan made these comments during his appearance before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week. Callahan also said that closely observing Ortega's relationship with the government of Iran will be "a priority" for him during his time as US Ambassador.
Dean's suspicions that Israeli agents may have also been involved in the mysterious plane crash in 1988 that killed Pakistan's president, General Mohammed Zia ul Haq, led finally to a decision in Washington to declare him mentally unfit, which forced his resignation from the foreign service after a thirty-year career. After he left public service, he was rehabilitated by the State Department, given a distinguished service medal and eventually encouraged to write his memoirs. Now 82, Dean sees the subsequent positive attention he has received as proof that the insanity charge (he calls it Stalinist) was phony, a supposition later confirmed by a former head of the department's medical service.
Pakistan was so dangerous that it was on the State Department's travel ban list for US Citizens. Non-Muslim visitors were not welcome unless sponsored by their embassy for official business.
Other day, I was talking to a lady in France over the phone. I asked her how many children she has? She said she has three. Then I asked her, why you don't send one of your children to Vanni to join the armed cadre of the Tamil Tigers. She immediately asked me why she should spare one of her child. I responded to her and said then only you can achieve the Tamil Eelam.
The sides also discussed the latest developments in efforts to broker a prisoner swap between Israel and the Hamas militant group. A top Hamas official in Damascus told The Associated Press that the group had rejected the latest proposal from Israel. He said Israel was refusing to release key prisoners and insisting on mass deportations of freed militants.

George W. Bush gave his final speech to the nation on Thursday night. I skipped it to see my daughter, who has known no other president, perform with her school chorus. But when I later sat before my television to see how the speech was being punditized on the cable news shows, I was surprised. The water-landing of a US Airways flight in New York City dominated the coverage. There was little chatter--almost nothing--about Bush's farewell.

You know I would never use that language on my blog, and especially when it comes to my #1 show "Dirty Sexy Money," but according to a student who attended a recent USC sitdown with the cast and creator of "Dirty Sexy Money" the scripts for the upcoming 3 episodes of the series were, according to Craig Wright himself "rough and, frankly, shitty."
Had only Small and Overgaard been involved, it is likely that hardly a word of concern would have been spoken about the sale of UPI. But, then, there were also the Nashville "mystery men" -- Ruhe and Geissler -- with their controversial pasts. When the news broke that they were involved, the same question was asked on Wall Street in New York and on Fleet Street in London as on Union Street in Nashville: "Who are Ruhe and Geissler?" As anecdote after anecdote trickled out to fill the information vacuum about the two men, it prompted a second inquiry: "Where did they get the money to purchase United Press International?" For they, indeed, had been labor organizers, civil rights demonstrators and war protestors during most of the decade of the 1960s. Both of them are active members of the Baha'i faith, an Eastern religion founded in Persia in the 19th century and considered an "exotic" creed because it was little known in American culture. Ruhe's father is one of nine international leaders of that religion. He left the United States 14 years ago to move to Haifa, Israel, the world headquarters of the Baha'i faith. Neither Ruhe nor Geissler earned an undergraduate college degree, but both received master's degrees in education from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst -- without writing a master's thesis. It was not required under the program they pursued. The dean of the school of education at Amherst, Dr. Dwight Allen, is a national leader of the Baha'l faith. Both Ruhe and Geissler, after leaving the University of Massachusetts, worked on the national staff of the Baha'i church in Wilmette, Ill., until five years ago. As information about the two "mystery men" began to come out, another important question emerged: Was there "Baha'i money" involved in the purchase of UPI? Only a few weeks before, the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon -- the so-called "Moonies" -- had started a newspaper, the Washington Times, in the nation's capital. Was UPI now to be under the financial control of the Baha'i faith? http://www.downhold.org/lowry/tenn.html

Gingrich said he decided to abandon his presidential ambitions for now rather than step down as chairman of the new group, called American Solutions. It claims 19,000 members and sponsored 2,000 workshops around the country, organized seminars online and conducted other programs Friday and Saturday. It aims to find comprehensive solutions to problems of immigration, national defense, education and other national issues, according to its Web site.
Gingrich said a last-minute analysis of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law indicated he could not continue as head of his American Solutions organization and still search out his chances for a White House run.
The influential Republican, whose candidacy would have likely made him an immediate top-tier candidate, said campaign finance laws would have barred him from forming an exploratory committee and continuing his leadership role at his American Solutions organization.

The Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), a government holding firm valued at 81.7 billion dollars, held talks this week with JPMorgan Chase and Co on ways to cooperate, ICD said on Tuesday.
The offer, equal to euro1.85 (US$2.78) a share, also allows shareholders to get bonds representing euro2.25 (US$3.38) a share, Investment Corp. of Dubai, or ICD, said in a filing to the Spanish market regulator. The bonds will be for four and a half years, the company added.
Spain's business daily Cinco Dias said Colonial was to hold a meeting with the banks later Tuesday to finalise the sale of key assets, which had been suspended for more than a month due to ICD's takeover bid.
Cheney underwent a stress test in which a radioactive agent is typically injected into the bloodstream to assess circulation, and doctors checked his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), also known as a pacemaker.

Shi Hongmei, an analyst with the Oriental Securities, said the appreciation of RMB and cut in export tax rebates would have a negative effect on domestic textile enterprises. Changes in the market environment would also boost industrial adjustment and integration, such eliminating  small and less competitive enterprises, and spurring mergers to form large textile conglomerates.
"I'm not sure what the 2007 figure will reveal on that, but I am sure China's GDP will surpass Germany in 2008," Feng Yuming, a Shanghai-based economist with Oriental Securities, told AFP.

"Deadliest Catch," which is shown on the Discovery Channel, and "Ice Road Truckers," on the History Channel, have become among the most popular programs on cable television. The finale of "Ice Road Truckers" attracted close to 5 million viewers. Beers, a former producer at Turner Broadcasting and Paramount's syndicated division, started his own company, Original Productions, in 1999, with a heavy emphasis on motorcycle shows and documentaries like "Plastic Surgery: Before and After" and "Ballroom Bootcamp." The company's signature hit was "Monster Garage," in which a standard car was "monsterized" into another kind of machine.

Thaksin's administration is branded as a populist one, whose policy platform caters mostly the country's rural and urban poor, with projects like 30-baht universal health care, One Tambon (sub- district) One Product (OTOP), Village Fund to promote development of rural enterprises and cheap housing for urban low- incomers, that earned him great support among the grass-root people, especially in the north and northeast, where the country's majority rural poor reside.
Somchai said at the end of a workshop which discussed ways to help rural poor that his government would move forward on the three projects including Village Fund, One Tambon ( sub-district) One Product (OTOP) and small and medium-sized lending (SML) program.
"These products represent not just saleable artworks, but a vivid demonstration of Taiwanese traditional arts infused with fashion, " said Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen, the sponsor of the project titled "One Town, One Product (OTOP)."
BREAST-HEALTH-DIET -- AUSTIN, Texas -- Every October, a flurry of pink things hits during breast cancer awareness month. But tactics for battling and preventing this disease are a year-round practice, beginning with the new year. "There is no magic food," Lori Valencic, corporate nutritionist for Randalls, says. "But what we eat matters. A plant-based diet is still the best." (Crider, Austin American-Statesman)
A Randalls official was mum about specific numbers, too, but said the store's private label sales had reached "record numbers in recent years."
The heavy rain caused a roof collapse that killed one person and injured another at about 11:30 a.m. near the loading dock at the Randalls store at Clear Lake City Boulevard and Space Center Boulevard. A man who is believed to have been a store employee was killed and another man was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital.
Ex-offenders looking to lead productive lives often run headfirst into unforgiving criminal background checks by employers using the state's Criminal Offender Record Information system, or CORI. Governor Patrick's CORI reform bill would seal such records sooner - 10 years instead of 15 for felonies and five years instead of 10 for misdemeanors. Sensibly, the reduced waiting period would not apply to sex offenders.
The state's Criminal Offender Record Information database does have significant flaws; CORI reports can be hard to interpret, often contain confusing data, and can end up barring even rehabilitated offenders from working in crucial sectors of the state's economy. This can have disastrous consequences particularly in poor, minority communities with high numbers of ex-cons. For this reason, the Globe has supported efforts by Governor Patrick and community leaders to reform the CORI system.
"He believes employers must have access to information for positions where the safety of employees, customers, clients, or the public is a concern," said his spokesman Kyle Sullivan. He added that Patrick "supports law enforcement having broad and unlimited access to CORI."
The strongest argument in favor of passage, to me, is that arrests for possession saddle offenders with criminal records. For that reason, Question 2 is supported by those who support reform of the Criminal Offender Record Information laws. I'm on record supporting CORI reform. But the records of first offenders are sealed after six months - or are supposed to be.
Since his release from jail over a year ago, Ferreira has worked as a prep cook in Cambridge, Mass., at Sodexo, a food services company, and dreams of opening a restaurant. Ferreira also envisions a future career working with at-risk youths. But he has a GED only, which offers limited work options, and he can't find a way to overcome the setback of his incarcerations. Every time someone considers him for work, his criminal background shows up in the Criminal Offender Record Information system, also known as CORI.
Saturn ranks No. 13 in resale value, measured over the past five years, among all automotive brands tracked by Kelley Blue Book -- the second best showing among GM brands behind Pontiac at No. 11.
For bankers, targeting a niche is a way to set themselves apart from their competition. "If a person sees three banks on the same block, each one offering the same products at the same price, what differentiates you?" asks Steven F. Young, senior vice president for consumer banking at Wainwright Bank and Trust in Boston. Wainwright's reputation as a socially responsible bank that invests most of its deposits in community development and progressive nonprofit organizations "has led us to be very profitable," Young said. "People like what we're doing with their money."
Lee's hallmark is to recommend specific brand names in her ingredient list. She said she doesn't get a kickback for the recommendations; they just reflect her actual dishes. The P-I asked about changing brands to fit our own tastes or budgets. We saw no reason to buy a container of McCormick's cinnamon, for instance, if we already had Spice Islands (or even better, an inexpensive bulk-bin bag) on our rack at home. Lee said to go ahead and substitute, just be aware that the taste of your final dish may not be the same as hers.
Lori Webb of Cedar Bluff, Ala., had a few flashbacks. "I, too, read the McCormick's ad [the spice company recommended tossing old spice tins]. I had not one or two, but nine of those tins! I love to try new recipes, which frequently meant picking up an unusual spice. If the recipe was not a keeper, the spice got shoved to the back of the cabinet.
Consider a grill pan filled with several paintbrushes from the hardware store - great for slapping on the sauce - and a variety of seasonings so that the grillmeister can concoct signature rubs. Include a good Spanish smoked paprika, chipotle powder, McCormick's fragrant new Gourmet Collection Chai spice blend and garlic powder. Check out local farmers markets for the best value in seasonings and spices.

In addition to works by well-known writers like Alice Munro, the 2007 edition of "The O. Henry Prize Stories" (Anchor), edited by Laura Furman, offers the striking "In a Bear's Eye," by Yannick Murphy. In just five pages, Murphy, who lives in Reading, Vt., masterfully explores the terrain between the living and the dead.
For me, old movies proved to be the answer, or an answer. (Turning off the TV set was another.) My daughters Eliza and Natalie learned to surf genres and decades as well as channels, to view black and white as an acceptable (sometimes even preferred) alternative, and to appreciate Jimmy Cagney and Bette Davis as irreducible singularities. Either I've broadened their cultural horizons or irretrievably warped them; ask me in 20 years. For now, here are a few samples from the book that resulted, "The Best Old Movies for Families" (Anchor).
Rabbi Harold Kushner is one of the most famous Jewish thinkers in the nation. He is best-known for his best-selling book, "When Bad Things Happen to Good People" (Anchor, $21).
He also said the American edition of his book, titled "The Life and Death of Classical Music," was "not affected" by the case. It was published by Anchor Books, a division of Random House.
US President George W. Bush donned a black leather biker jacket Sunday as he was given honorary membership in the Rolling Thunder motorcycle group which paraded through Washington to honor veterans on Memorial Day.
As the war in Iraq continues into the summer of its sixth year, President Bush will take part Monday in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery and speak at the annual Memorial Day commemoration there. The president met Sunday with leaders of the Rolling Thunder motorcycling group and was told of reports that veterans are being misdiagnosed. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee last week requested an investigation into whether the Department of Veterans Affairs has encouraged physicians to avoid diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as a cost-cutting tactic.
Near the Vietnam Memorial, women in the anti-war group Code Pink sang "All We Are Saying Is Give Peace of Chance" as they walked a sidewalk gauntlet of leathers-clad Vietnam veterans in the motorcycle group Rolling Thunder who chanted "USA. USA. USA."
International praise was heaped on the 1994 "Chungking Express", a quirky romantic comedy that Quentin Tarantino liked so much that he selected it as the first product of his Rolling Thunder distribution company.
The probe into the Hayats sprang from a wider investigation into the 2,500-strong Pakistani community in Lodi, a region best known for farming and wine-growing just outside Sacramento.
"My 88-year-old mother asks me regularly, `Why would anybody want to be president now?' said Sullivan, who manages the Presidential Transition Project at Rice University. "My answer is 'Every one of them wants to be FDR.' This is their chance. What makes fame in the American presidency is a great challenge and succeeding." Or, Sullivan added, facing a great challenge and failing.
About half of the 4.9 billion ringgit (US$1.4 billion; euro billion) that Telekom will devote for overseas capital spending this year will be for Indonesia, where Telekom owns 60 percent of cellular phone company PT Excelcomindo Pratama, Chief Executive Abdul Wahid Omar said.
In total, TM International Sdn Bhd will hold stakes in eight mobile service providers including Celcom in Malaysia, PT Excelcomindo Pratama in Indonesia, Sri Lanka's Dialog Telekom, Spice Communications in India and TM International Ltd in Bangladesh.
TM International, whose foreign units include PT Excelcomindo Pratama in Indonesia, TM International in Bangladesh and Spice Communications in India, expects to increase revenue from its cellular operations for the full year.
Ma and Hsieh made the remarks in the debate organized by the CNA, the Public Television Foundation and four local newspapers. The organizers consider the debate to be a decisive factor in the presidential campaign.
The debate organized by Taiwan's Central News Agency, the Public Television Foundation and four local newspapers, was aimed at providing two hopefuls, Ma and Hsieh a forum to give voters a better picture of how they would lead the nation in the coming four years.
The debate, the last one before the March 22 election, was organized  by the Central News Agency,  the Public Television Foundation and four newspapers.
Aging oil fields that make up the bulk of Venezuelan production require heavy investment. PVDSA must inject natural gas to raise the pressure of deposits underground, and spend on improving wells and facilities to keep the oil flowing. Largely untapped deposits in the Orinoco River region are among the world's most promising, but also require enormous investment to convert the heavy tar-like crude into usable oils.
Gabrielli, speaking to reporters on the sidelines at the Mercosur trade bloc summit, said Petrobras will have a 60 percent stake in the refinery and PVDSA will have a 40 percent state.
After Krukowski-Rastelli, 65, filed a petition in Queens Family Court seeking visitation rights, a legal guardian appointed on her grandson's behalf interviewed the grandson and recommended the petition be dismissed. They have not seen each other in almost four years.
When they respond to disasters, chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team usually encounter throngs of desperate victims.

The CIAA, acting on a report submitted by the Rayamajhi Commission which is the anti-corruption watchdog constituted following the April 2006 mass movement, Tuesday told former ministers Kamal Thapa, Dan Bahadur Shahi, Tanka Dhakal and Shrish SJB Rana to appear in the commission within seven days.
In a written reply, the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet, Madhav Paudel, said the decision had been taken as the former ministers have been implicated in the report prepared by the Rayamajhi Commission headed by former judge of Supreme Court Krishna Jung Rayamajhi that probed suppression of the people's movement.
A huge explosion rocked a Christian neighborhood in Beirut on Friday morning. Lebanese Red Cross Committee announced that four people were killed and 20 injured in the blast, which occurred in the Chevrolet neighborhood northeast of Beirut around 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT).

Under Malaysia's rotating monarchy, the Sultan of Terengganu is currently serving as king and the state's affairs are formally handled by a Regency Advisory Council.
The Sultan of Terengganu is at present the Malaysian King and has by law delegated his powers to his son who is only eight years old and so co-reigns with a three-member Regency Advisory Council.

Elaborate steps to protect judges, prosecutors and other senior Iraqi officials involved in the case have been taken by American officials at the Regime Crimes Liaison Office, a unit of the American embassy.
William H. Wiley, one of the lawyers now speaking out, worked in the Regime Crimes Liaison Office, the U.S. agency that set up, financed and counseled the Iraqi High Tribunal, the special court constituted to hear cases against senior Saddam-era officials. Wiley, 44, a Canadian who advised Iraqi defense lawyers at the trial, said the Maliki government, not the liaison office or officials in Washington monitoring the trial, was at fault for subverting due process in Saddam's case.
Considered as Saddam's right-hand man and a member of the Revolution Command Council, he was regularly called upon to crush regional uprisings.
The Revolution were without defender Chris Albright (lower extremity), midfielders Mauricio Castro (groin), Jeff Larentowicz (quadriceps contusion), and Steve Ralston (quadriceps strain), and forward Taylor Twellman (hip flexor strain). That didn't include Adam Cristman (toe sprain) and Gary Flood (ankle sprain), who already were scheduled to sit out.
At Carson, California, Adam Cristman scored two goals in a 4-minute span to give the Revolution a victory over the Galaxy.
New England scored twice within five minutes to take a 2-1 lead. Adam Cristman's half-volley settled inside the right post to make it 1-1 in the 47th minute.
Forward Adam Cristman (University of Virginia) is a finalist for MLS Rookie of the Year and Wells Thompson (Wake Forest) has become a starter in his first season; they are part of a trend that includes former Revolution Rookies of the Year Clint Dempsey (Furman, in South Carolina) in 2004 and Michael Parkhurst (Wake Forest) in 2005.
Reis stopped Ngwenya in the 74th minute. Onstad touched the ball off the right post after Wells Thompson's shot deflected off Andy Dorman in the 82d minute. And the Revolution's Adam Cristman headed wide off a buildup from Steve Ralston to Twellman in the fourth minute of added time.
Rookie striker Adam Cristman scored twice and Pat Noonan added a goal in the first half to help New England (5-2-4) take a 3-2 lead.
Instead, he selectively pressured defenders, just enough to funnel them into an uncomfortable position while his younger strike partner, Adam Cristman, went on search-and-destroy missions. And when it was time to hold the ball, Twellman combined strength and a soft touch to draw defenders.
New England rookie Adam Cristman scored his fourth goal in the 91st minute, converting a cross on the left side from midfielder Steve Ralston.
The Revolution began the match aggressively. Twellman slammed a 25-yard shot from the right of the penalty area in the opening seconds, Hartman's diving save leading to a corner kick. Adam Cristman headed wide twice, in the first minute and off an Andy Dorman free kick in the 16th.
Larentowicz scored his second career goal off Ralston's corner kick in the 16th minute, flying feet first to meet the ball and send it past Matt Pickens. Larentowicz started the sequence that led to the corner, sending a through ball to Adam Cristman.

Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, also believes the market is engaged in the sometimes messy process of establishing a base.
Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said the steps taken by governments abroad are welcome because a broad response, not simply the U.S. bailout, is needed to help steady the world's financial system.
"Even though the banking sector may be returning to normal, the economy still isn't. The economy continues to face a host of other problems," said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com. "We're in for a tough ride."
Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, contends the ability of banks like Morgan Stanley and earlier Citigroup Inc. to arrange cash infusions from well-healed foreign governments appeared to quiet some of Wall Street's unease.
"Even though the banking sector may be returning to normal, the economy still isn't. The economy continues to face a host of other problems," said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com. "We're in for a tough ride."
The market is likely to be driven by earnings over the coming weeks, said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. "The market will start to stabilize. You'll see some backing and filling in the market, which you're seeing right now," he said.
The best strategy for investors, analysts said, is to prepare for turbulence and invest for the long term. "Stick to your plan. Make sure the money you have in the equity market you don't need for a while -- hopefully for 10 years, but no less than five years. It's going to be a wild ride for a while," said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for New Jersey-based Channel Capital Research.

He was taken to hospital for x-rays and surgery, adding to the problems of an All Blacks team which has already lost locks James Ryan and Jason Eaton to injuries and lost Keith Robinson before the match to a calf strain.
The Hurricanes' stuttering win over the Highlanders was made costly by a knee injury to All Blacks lock Jason Eaton, who will be sidelined for six months and has been ruled out of New Zealand's World Cup campaign.
It was poor tackling round the fringes which led to the Hurricanes' first try. Jason Eaton picked up a loose ball from a ruck and ran through some weak tackling from 10 meters out.
Japan's Foreign Ministry said Kazuya Ito, 31, was kidnapped near the city of Jalalabad. It established a task force in Kabul to seek his release.
"Recent expectations that financial markets have hit bottom were reversed in one day," said Kazuya Ito, a fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments. "There is persisting underlying instability in financial markets."
Kazuya Ito, the 31-year-old Abductee, was from Shizuoka Prefecture, Kyodo News reported, citing the NGO's local office in Kabul.
Kazuya Ito, the 31-year-old abductee from Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture, was kidnapped along with the driver at around 7:00 local time (0230 GMT) near Jalalabad after their car was surrounded by alleged Taliban militants, Kyodo News reported, citing the NGO's local office in Kabul.

"Alexandra" --  Opera star Galina Vishnevskaya plays an elderly woman visiting her grandson, an army officer, at his base in Chechnya. On the surface it is a work of the utmost simplicity but is charged with the eternal complexities and contradictions of both love and war. (1:35) Unrated. "Beyond the Call" -- Documentary about three straight-shooting, aging Americans who hop the globe on their own dime providing humanitarian aid to the Third World's neediest citizens. Writer-director Adrian Belic tagged along with the film's intrepid trio as they swooped in to such impoverished trouble spots as Afghanistan, the Philippines and the Thai-Myanmar border with donated or massively discounted food and medical supplies.  (1:21) Unrated. "Blind Mountain" -- Li Yang's utterly uncompromising depiction of the kidnapping of a young college graduate who is sold off to a brutal farmer in a remote mountain village becomes a shattering commentary on the worship of money in a society so wracked by economic expansion that it is destroying traditional Chinese values and ethics. In Mandariin, Shaanxi dialect, with English subtitles.  (1:36) Unrated. Sexual violence and pervasive brutality. "Body of War" --  A documentary about the political awakening of an Iraq war veteran after he's paralyzed from the chest down after serving five days in Iraq. It's an indictment of the tactical politics that led to the invasion and a heartbreaking account of one man living with the consequences.  (1:40) Unrated. "Bra Boys" -- This documentary about an Australian "surf tribe" is easily dismissible as gang war at sea. There's poverty, single moms, alienated teens, casual violence and a celebrity narrator (Russell Crowe). But there is a redemptive quality at play here that cannot be found in the lives of most urban street gangs: the pull of the ocean and its momentary ability to provide a sanctified experience.  (1:24) R for language, some violent content and reckless behavior. "Chaos Theory" --  This film is not exactly bad, not outrageously so anyway, but it disappointingly never really discovers the movie that it wants to be. A man tells his soon-to-be son-in-law the tale of how his marriage  once nearly fell apart and the ways in which the experience deeply changed how he has looked at the world ever since. The cast members twist themselves into knots trying to sell the story.  (1:25) PG-13 for thematic material, sexual conduct and language. "Constantine's Sword" --  This documentary finds former priest James Carroll probing into a billions-strong Christian faith he believes is long overdue an honest reckoning with its violent past.  (1:35) Unrated. "Dare Not Walk Alone" -- The raw power of footage depicting '60s era civil rights protesters and their usually harsh treatment at the hands of white authorities is an evergreen gut punch, and this documentary about the lesser-publicized role St. Augustine, Fla., played then in awakening the country makes extensive use of it.  (1:11) Unrated. "Dark Matter" --  This film dramatizes the story of a Chinese cosmology student (Liu Ye) pursuing graduate work in the United States who eventually lashes out in a dramatic and violent way. It is easy to see the film as two movies crammed together -- one about politics in academia, the other about the fine line between genius and mental illness -- neither of them being very good.  (1:30) R for a scene of violence, brief sexual content and language. "Deal" --  Burt Reynolds plays a former big-shot poker player who takes a cocky young upstart under his wing. There are complications along the way, and, next thing you know, they're both in the big tournament. Replace pool for poker and it's "The Color of Money" done badly.  (1:26) PG-13 for language, sexual content and brief drug use. "The First Saturday in May" -- Filmmakers Brad and John Hennegan follow six horses and their trainers through the arduous 2006 race season, building up to the Kentucky Derby, but they are never able to find the balance between insider wonkery and genuine human (or animal) drama. (1:40) Unrated. "The Flight of the Red Balloon" --  This film by Taiwanese director Hsiao-hsien Hou is a homage to Albert Lamorisse's "Le Ballon Rouge," the nearly silent 1956 film about a little boy who is followed around Paris by a giant red balloon. Hou's version, which is neither a remake nor a sequel, is the story of a little boy, his single mother and his nanny, a Taiwanese film student studying in Paris. The camera is so unobtrusive and the acting so naturalistic that it takes a while for a narrative to emerge. When it finally does, you're surprised to find you're deeply invested in the characters. In French with English subtitles.  (1:53) Unrated. "A Four Letter Word" --  A gay romantic comedy swirling around the Manhattan milieu of party boys, prostitutes, addicts and activists. Although the film has a certain freewheeling energy, it is often undercut by an overall sense of amateur-hour awkwardness, with back-and-forth dialogue often segueing into long-winded monologue.  (1:27) Unrated. "Four Minutes" --  Though crafted with obvious skill and vision by writer-director Chris Kraus, this German import is so oppressive it suffocates its potentially strong themes and characterizations. It might also be the most unsatisfyingly unsentimental, least cathartic teacher-student drama ever made. (1:52) Unrated. "Jack and Jill vs. the World" --  Bubbly to the point of indigestion and mechanical about ticking off the romantic trajectory, the movie is blind to the fact that it should be rising up against its own formulaic kind.  (1:29) PG for sexual content and brief strong language. "Jellyfish" -- Seductive and intoxicating, playfully surreal and inexplicably moving, this unexpected Israeli film is almost impossible to pin down or even categorize. Artistic, daring, surprising, it resists fitting into words at all. Modern-day life in Israel is portrayed through the lives of three Tel Aviv women.  (1:18) Unrated. "Kiss the Bride" --  A gay man rushes home when he learns his ex- boyfriend is getting married -- to a woman. With Tori Spelling, Philipp Karner, James O'Shea, Joanna Cassidy, Tess Harper and Robert Foxworth. Directed by C. Jay Cox. R for sexual content and language. "The Life Before Her Eyes" --  Vadim Perelman's film is adapted from a well-regarded novel by Laura Kasischke. The movie has its good points, too, notably another eerily mesmerizing performance by Evan Rachel Wood. But there's an airtight quality to the movie, an off-kilter contemporary gothic complete with weird nuns, writhing Pentecostals and a disaffected high school kid with a semiautomatic weapon, that makes it feel like a formal exercise.  (1:30) R for violent and disturbing content, language and brief drug use. "Lost in Beijing" --  Li Yu's film is a cautionary tale about how people in China's fast-rising economy come to the capital city only to lose their moorings in a frenzied, materialistic society. The film benefits from solid performances by its stars, but it is overly didactic and drawn- out as its comic tone grows darker and darker. In Mandarin with English subtitles. (1:53) Unrated with strongly adult themes. "Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037" --  As a meditation on the making of pianos and music as well as an aesthetic experience in and of itself, "Note by Note," like the Steinway company it profiles, does things the old-fashioned way. If a piano or its music has ever pleased you, this film will as well. (1:21) Unrated. "Orthodox Stance" --  Jason Hutt's documentary portrait of Dmitriy Salita, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, becoming a professional boxer is surprisingly uninspired. The problem lies chiefly with Salita himself who -- for better or for worse -- lacks the sort of brash charisma and inner turmoil normally associated with boxers.  (1:23) Unrated. "The Rocker" -- Twenty years after getting kicked out of an '80s hair band, a drummer gets a second chance to live his rock dreams in his nephew's high school group. With Rainn Wilson and Christina Applegate. Directed by Peter Cattaneo. "Shotgun Stories" --  This film, which traces three very different brothers whose bond is tested by a vengeful eruption with another family, is an understated gem. Writer-director Jeff Nichols, making his feature debut, has created a richly textured world.  (1:32) PG-13 for violence, thematic elements and brief strong language. "Sunflower" --  In the latest from Chinese writer-director Zhang Yang, the discord between a father and son across the '70s, '80s and '90s plays out against a backdrop of the rapid changes affecting life in Beijing. The film wears its ambitions toward allegory quite plainly, but Zhang's storytelling feels like that of an outdated melodrama, never letting "Sunflower" really shine. In Mandarin with English subtitles.  (2:09) Unrated. "The Take" --  John Leguizamo is an armored-car driver whose life is destroyed when a hijacker forces him to participate in a robbery, then shoots him in the head. Director Brad Furman, in his feature film debut, uses discipline and empathy to put the viewer in the character's shoes. Furman's tour through L.A.'s Boyle Heights neighborhood is colorful and authentic.  (1:36) R for violence, sexual content, language and some drug use. "Then She Found Me" --  Helen Hunt's directorial debut is a warm, entertaining and well-made dramatic comedy (or comedic drama) about a woman desperate for a baby who gets pregnant with her husband's (Matthew Broderick) child shortly after he leaves her and she becomes involved with someone else (Colin Firth) at the same time that she is grieving the death of her adoptive mother and dealing with her birth mother coming back into her life.  (1:40) R for language and some sexual content. "The Visitor" --  An unassuming but quietly heartbreaking drama about the unexpected bonds that can form in a city like New York -- and their depth and fragility in times of hysteria. It's tempting to describe this film as a story about the effect of draconian post-Sept. 11 immigration laws on individuals. It's much more than that.  (1:48) PG-13 for brief strong language. "Water" --  This Russian-produced torpid examination of the structural powers of H20, despite crisp cinematography and lots of gorgeous imagery, belongs strictly in high school science classes. The film posits that water has a memory and that its properties can be altered by human emotion. (1:25) Unrated. "Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden" -- Filmmaker-gadfly Morgan Spurlock is back with the warm, amusing and decidedly mistitled film. The movie consists mostly of Spurlock's sometimes charming, sometimes alarming visits with citizens throughout the Middle East as he supposedly searches for bin Laden, the man, as well as bin Laden, the idea.  (1:30) PG-13 for some strong language. "Young and Restless in China" --  Over a four-year period, nine young people from across China pursue their hopes and dreams for success amid a fast-paced economy in this documentary. Directed by Sue Williams. "Young at Heart" -- A New England senior citizens group inspires its audiences by performing songs by the Clash, Coldplay, Sonic Youth and James Brown in this documentary. Directed by Stephen Walker. PG for some mild language and thematic elements. "Zombie Strippers" -- To continue wars in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Canada and Alaska, the fourth-term Bush administration's military has developed a virus that will reanimate fallen fighters, allowing them to fight on as flesh-hungry super-soldiers. The virus gets out and turns Jenna Jameson and her sartorially challenged cohorts into rapidly decaying super-strippers. This is a B-movie whose ideas and wit set it well above the great unwashed of the genre.  (1:34) R for strong violence and gore, sexuality, nudity and language.

"We are heading for a climate crisis unless EU leaders pull their socks up and address the challenge by reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020," said Mahi Sideridou from Greenpeace. "The proposed 20 percent reduction is way short of the mark."
Electricity producers like E.On and RWE in Germany and Vattenfall, the Swedish energy company, also benefited from free allowances, by passing on costs to their customers, according to Jos Sijm, a senior economist at the Energy Research Center of the Netherlands, who tracks the issue. "The first phase definitely did not deliver reductions in emissions," said Mahi Sideridou, the European Union climate policy director for Greenpeace in Brussels. In the United States, General Motors, Duke Energy and others have lined up in favor of European-style quotas, leading many environmentalists and experts to question whether these companies would be required to do enough to change their business practices in ways that create an effective transition to a cleaner environment.
The EU will "stand accused of a scientific and political blunder," said Mahi Sideridou, climate and energy policy director at Greenpeace's EU office.
However, environmentalists were quick to pour scorn on the proposals with Greenpeace expert Mahi Sideridou predicting: "If the Commission recommends ... a meagre 20 percent greenhouse gas emissions target for Europe for 2020, it will stand accused of a scientific and political blunder."
"When we did the exhibition, it was a critical point in Herb Ritts' career, and it was an important moment for the museum as well," MFA director Malcolm Rogers told The Boston Globe on Thursday, when the gift was announced.
But MFA director Malcolm Rogers defended the decision to show the Hartman jades. He said that the 207 ornate carved works the MFA exhibited in 2003-04 make up a "superb" collection that deserved to be seen based on its artistic merits, and that it is unlikely the museum's decision to exhibit them had any influence on the prices they would fetch in the increasingly hot jade market.
Detective John McClane ( Willis) is sent to pick up one of the surviving white-hat hackers, Matt Farrell. Matt arrives on screen with a good-geek image and a tongue-in-cheek subtext, because he is played by Justin Long, best known from the commercials in which he represents a Mac as the cool, fast, up-to-the-minute computer that always outshines the PC, depicted as a staid man in a suit.
Computer geek Matt Farrell (Justin Long) is one of many digital wizards the feds want to question after the bureau's cyber- security division is hacked.
Matthew Russell expected his work to be exhausting but intriguing. "It's cool to meet people from all around the world, from different backgrounds and cultures."
"The firm is confident in its legal case and fully expects its funds to be repaid," Lehman Brothers spokesman Matthew Russell said in a statement, adding that there was no impact on the bank's earnings.
Opening statements began in the trial of Melanie McGuire nearly three years after suitcases full of body parts washed up along Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.
Melanie McGuire is charged with first-degree murder in the April 2004 killing of her husband, William T. McGuire, 39. She pleaded not guilty and has remained free on $2.1 million bail.
Melanie McGuire, who wept as she heard the verdict, was convicted of murder, desecration of a corpse, perjury and a weapons offense.
In her closing argument, Assistant Attorney General Patricia Prezioso portrayed Melanie McGuire as an organized, capable woman. McGuire, 34, is accused of drugging William McGuire, shooting him, then putting his body parts into three matching Kenneth Cole suitcases in April 2004.
They played a role in the murder case against Melanie McGuire, a New Jersey nurse convicted in April of killing her husband and tossing his cut-up remains into the Chesapeake Bay in three matching suitcases in 2004. Prosecutors used toll records to reconstruct her movements.
Melanie McGuire, 34, was convicted of murder and desecrating human remains in the 2004 death of William McGuire, 39.
"There is no proof that Melanie McGuire murdered her husband," said the defense attorney, Joseph Tacopina. "This case is a result of a tragic rush to judgment. They saw what they wanted to see. They heard what they wanted to hear."
Melanie McGuire, 34, was convicted in April of killing William McGuire, 39, whose body washed up in 2004 in the couple's three Kenneth Cole suitcases.
The original, directed by Delmer Daves from a script by Halsted Welles, starred Glenn Ford as Wade and Van Heflin as Evans. Mangold ("Walk the Line"), working from a script by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, gives us a deeper understanding of these key players and broadens the roles of several peripheral figures.
Written by: Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, based on a short story by Elmore Leonard
Directed by James Mangold from a script by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, "3:10 to Yuma," which opens nationwide Friday, remakes a 1957 film of the same title (based on the same Elmore Leonard story), which starred Glenn Ford as the charming baddie and Van Heflin as the rancher who risks everything to escort him to a rendezvous with justice.
Adapted by Halstead Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas from an Elmore Leonard short story about courage and manhood in the face of terror, surely "3:10 to Yuma" was meant to.
And while they've kept the best parts of Elmore Leonard's source story and Halsted Welles' screenplay, this one's adapters -- Michael Brandt and Derek Haas -- have greatly improved dialogue; worked in engaging new characters, situations and themes; and have come up with a way of making the thing, well, move. The core psychological tussle between the captured Wade and his only dedicated guard, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), in an Arizona hotel room is still the key dramatic element of the piece. It's just not half the movie anymore.
"We just want to show our support for China," said one student, Michael Chen. "We are not protesting anything."
It will be the second time that Liz Mohn will be pivotal in the selection of the company's new chief executive. Her clash with the former chief, Thomas Middelhoff, over his ambitions to take the company public ultimately ended in his ouster in 2002.
Similarly, Georgia will lose only two starters on defense, safety Kelin Johnson and defensive end Marcus Howard. On offense, wide receivers Mikey Henderson and Sean Bailey and linemen Fernando Velasco and Chester Adams are finished.
But No. 22 Georgia defeated the 16th-ranked Crimson Tide, 26-23, in overtime on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to wide receiver Mikey Henderson to stun a sellout crowd of more than 92,000.
5. Thankfully for us, Mikey Henderson is small enough to store away in a locker and we can bring him out when we really need a game-winner.
At Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mikey Henderson caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford in overtime to lift Georgia to a victory.

The defendants named in a 42-count indictment in 2004 are Holy Land itself; Baker; Ghassan Elashi, its chairman; Abdulrahman Odeh; Mohammad El-Mezain; and Mufid Abdulqader. Two other men named in the indictment remain fugitives.
In addition to Holy Land, the defendants include Shukri Abu Baker, the charity's president; Ghassan Elashi, its chairman; Abdulrahman Odeh, the group's New Jersey representative; Mohammad El-Mezain, the group's original chairman; and Mufid Abdulqader, a top fundraiser. Two other men named in the indictment remain fugitives.
In a videotape played for the jury, defendant Mufid Abdulqader performed a skit in which he pretended to choke a character identified as a Jew. In a phone call intercepted shortly after a Hamas suicide bomber killed 18 Israelis, Abdulrahman Odeh told fellow defendant Mohammad El-Mezain that "a beautiful operation just took place."
The jurors in the high-profile case acquitted Mohammad El-Mezain, the former chairman of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, on virtually all the charges brought against him and deadlocked on the other charges that had been lodged against four other former leaders of the charity.
Kuwaiti oil minister Mohammed al-Eleim said Monday that OPEC was "undoubtedly inclined" to cut production. But he added that any decision would balance the need for a cut with its impact on the ailing world economy and producer nations' need for revenue to fund development projects.
But Mohammed al-Eleim said Monday that any decision at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' Dec. 17 Oran, Algeria, meeting would balance the need for a cut with its impact on the ailing world economy and producer nations' need for revenue to fund development projects.
Electricity and Water: Mohammed al-Eleim
Kuwait Oil Minister Mohammed al-Eleim, asked whether a cut was ineviable, said, "I think (so). But we have to balance everything together."
Both sides appeared on a new collision course on Saturday as Hamas accused Fatah of kidnapping Mohammed Ghazal, one of its leaders in the West Bank, and warned Abbas he would be held responsible.

FAPA President C.T. Lee states: " Mexico's behavior last week was not only unacceptable but cowardly and shameful as well. With forcing Mexico to treat President Chen this way, Beijing hit a new low. With these dastardly deeds, Beijing not only harassed and offended Taiwan, but everybody else who cares about Taiwan such as Congressman Tancredo."
In a letter addressed to Ban, Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) President C.T. Lee rejected Ban's argument that the United Nations takes the position that "Taiwan is part of China" under Resolution 2758 adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1971.
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) President C.T. Lee applauded the resolution, saying "the policy of dual recognition will be the most effective way for the United States to manifest its support for democratic countries around the world and to counter China's ambition of invading Taiwan."
Meanwhile, C.T. Lee, president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to promote international support for Taiwan's  cause, echoed Tancredo's view, saying the State Department reaction to Taiwan's "name rectification" campaign is an irony.

Prosecutor Carl Brizzi said his office would seek a two-year prison term for Dyer when she is sentenced Aug. 20. He said it was just luck that the boy was not hurt.
He concluded that some of the Hatto recordings he looked at had been tampered with in an apparent move to evade detection. He found, for example, that one track had been slowed down by more than 15 percent; when the effect was reversed, the engineer concluded that the track had originally been published on a recording attributed to pianist Carlo Grante. ``We have yet to investigate a Hatto recording that has not proved to be a hoax,'' he wrote.
Rose, who runs Pristine Classical, a small company based near St. Emilion in southwest France, has since created a Web page (pristineclassical.com/HattoHoax.html) where Liszt recordings by Hatto can be heard alongside those by Simon. Rose has also concluded that Hatto's supposed recording of Godowsky's studies after Chopin etudes was in fact the work of Carlo Grante.
"The film is probably very beautiful and well done," Carlo Rienzi, president of the Codacons consumer group, said in a statement. "However, minors must be protected more than the economic interests of film production companies."

By the time Immelman walked toward Camellia - no, not his wife Carminita, we're talking the par-4 10th hole - he was 10 under and his closest pursuer was Flesch, two back. The picture changed slightly when a roar went up ahead. Woods, who had bogeyed the 10th to fall six back, somehow managed to make a putt of at least 70 feet at the 11th, getting back within five and surely that sent a message to Immelman, right?

Celine Charveriat, Oxfam International's deputy advocacy director said: "Biofuels are not only a major cause of increasing prices but are also linked to labour rights abuses and land grabs in developing countries.

Dr. Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, agreed with their preliminary diagnosis.
It was not clear why the treatment succeeded with one child and failed with the others. Factors could include the strain of the virus, the dosing of the drugs and the time between infection and treatment, said Dr. Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"The elimination of canine rabies in the United States represents one of the major public health success stories in the last 50 years," stated Charles Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Program.
Rickey traded Dahlgren to Philadelphia before the season, and during a trip to play the Dodgers, Dahlgren and a teammate, Danny Litwhiler, encountered Charlie Dressen, a former Dodgers coach. Dressen said Rickey was asked by his bosses why he traded Dahlgren, and "Rickey told them he traded you because you smoke marijuana."
"In a clubhouse meeting, our manager, Charlie Dressen, got up and read the letter to us about how if Jackie took the field, he'll be shot," Carl Erskine, a revered Dodger right-hander of that era, recalled over the telephone. "There was complete silence. But then Gene Hermanski," the Dodger left fielder at the time, "piped up: 'Hey, Skip, I've got an idea. If we all wore 42 out there, they won't know who to shoot."'
At the other end of the managerial ego spectrum we had Charlie Dressen, who was sort of a Triple A Leo Durocher. Charlie was Charlie's biggest fan, once telling his Cincinnati team, "Hang in there boys; I'll think of something."
Later as a manager, he would assemble as many irregulars as he could get away with for the long haul from Yankees camp, sparing his stars. Now he is following Leo Durocher, Charlie Dressen, Walter Alston and Lasorda and a few lesser managers in between.

Sen. Susan Collins (R), a popular centrist, is leading in polls over Democratic Rep. Tom Allen, but both House seats are being contested. In the 1st district, Chellie Pingree appears to be the frontrunner over Charlie Summers, an Iraq veteran who previously worked for Senator Olympia Snowe. In the 2nd district, incumbent Rep. Michael Michaud, who opposes abortion and has been endorsed by the NRA -- is favored over Republican John Frary, a college professor.
To that end, Beaman changed the magazine's name to Politics, perked up the design and began running articles that you don't have to be a campaign wonk to appreciate. The March issue, for instance, has an interesting piece about how both parties can compete for the votes of young "cultural libertarians." It also has a cogent explanation of the byzantine rules for Democratic delegates and superdelegates, and a profile of Charlie Summers, a naval reservist from Maine who is running for Congress while serving in Iraq.
Defense lawyer Charlie Swift, the retired Navy officer who was assigned to represent Hamdan five years ago and took his challenge of the tribunal to the U.S. Supreme Court and won, asked the jurors to keep in mind that American justice is based on law, not vengeance.
Hamdan defense lawyer Charlie Swift concluded his cross- examination of the film's producer, terrorism consultant Evan F. Kohlmann, by asking if Hitler's driver was prosecuted for war crimes. Kohlmann said he did not know.
Defense lawyer Charlie Swift noted that Hamdan had been charged only with conspiracy in the original indictment in 2004, charges that were nullified in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the tribunal system established by the Bush administration was unconstitutional. Congress passed the Military Commissions Act establishing a new system four months later.
Hamdan's defense lawyer, Charlie Swift, objected to the video being shown, contending that it was "extraordinarily prejudicial." He accused the prosecution of "trying to terrorize the members" of the jury.
"If they (lawmakers) want to go in, they have to walk through us, including the prime minister," one of the protest leaders, Chatuporn Prompan, told reporters outside the Parliament compound where demonstrators spent the night.

Outgoing Vice President Annette Lu and two other leading DPP members -- Yu Shyi- kun, a former party chairman and ex-premier, and former foreign minister Chen Tan-sun -- are on trial on corruption and forgery charges in other cases involving special expenses.
At Friday's session, Chen's key aide, Chen Tan-sun, and four other officials were fined 30,000 New Taiwan dollars each for failing to show up in court. They had been called to give evidence.
Lu has vowed to fight the charges, but Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), resigned his post over the allegations. Former foreign minister Chen Tan-sun has been indicted on similar charges.
The DPP lawmakers, including Lai Ching-te, Chen Ting-fei and Wong Chin-chu, urged Ma and the KMT to apologize for Kuan's statement, claiming that it means that Ma has failed to keep his campaign promise of adopting a "no unification, no independence and no use of force" stance concerning  cross-Taiwan  Strait ties during his four-year tenure.

That is why Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines, which has over-the-ocean flights to Alaska and Hawaii, is going with a satellite-based system through Row 44 Inc. Row 44 is using an existing satellite network from Hughes Communications Inc. rather than trying to assemble its own as Boeing had.

"Americans always arrest or kill some people and link them somehow to the Quds Army," foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said.
Al-Dabbagh said the group was established in 1990 and settled near Kufa after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. He added that the area used to be run by Saddam's paramilitary Quds Army.
Instead, all the attention is on Witter's undefeated English rival, Ricky Hatton, who is seeking to win back the IBF light welterweight belt from Juan Urango in Las Vegas on Saturday. Hatton relinquished the title to move up to welterweight, where he beat Luis Collazo in May.
Luis Collazo will try to get back in welterweight world title mix on Saturday when he takes on veteran Shane Mosley for the World Boxing Council interim crown.
Hatton also recognises that he has a point to prove after piling on the pounds in the wake of his only fight last year, in which he won the WBA welterweight belt by out-pointing New Yorker Luis Collazo.
Las Vegas -- boxing, Luis Collazo vs. Shane Mosley for IBF welterweight title.
What Mosley did Saturday night was turn back the clock with a win over Luis Collazo that was impressive for several reasons. In doing so he also staked a claim as the second-best welterweight in the world behind Mayweather.
In his past four fights dating back to Feb. 25, 2006, Mosley stopped Fernando Vargas twice and decisioned Luis Collazo before losing to Cotto.
Shane Mosley wants to fight until he's 40. The way he looked Saturday night against Luis Collazo, he might consider extending his career even longer.
Hatton (41-0, 30 KOs) is in final preparations for the chance to reclaim his 63 1/2-kilo (140-pound) IBF title Saturday night. Colombia's Juan Urango claimed the belt last June after Hatton relinquished it to move up to welterweight, where he barely beat Luis Collazo in a gritty 12-round decision last May in Boston.
Looking spry for a 35-year-old who has logged many rounds in the ring, Mosley won the World Boxing Council welterweight title on Saturday night by rolling to a 12-round unanimous decision against Luis Collazo of Brooklyn, N.Y.
Hatton had vacated the title he won with a technical knockout of Kostya Tszyu when he moved up in class to beat Luis Collazo for the World Boxing Association welterweight crown last May.
Hatton had vacated the title when he moved up in class to beat Luis Collazo for the World Boxing Association welterweight crown last May.
The chances of Hatton moving back up to welterweight following 12 uninspiring rounds against Luis Collazo last year appeared remote, but the 28-year-old Manchester native must compromise if he wants to face Mayweather.
Retired army Gen. Muchdi Purwoprandjono, 59, was arrested in June on charges of involvement in the poisoning of Munir Thalib, who died of an arsenic overdose in September 2004 while flying from Jakarta to Amsterdam aboard the state airline, Garuda.

The agency director's assistant, Muchdi Purwo Prandjono knew Pollycarpus, and roughly three months before Munir's murder, ordered that the Garuda pilot be paid more than $1,100, the written testimony said.
Former deputy chief of the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (BIN) Maj. General (retired) Muchdi Purwopranjono was accused of misusing his position for premeditating the assassination of activist Munir.
No Marines have been charged in the episode. A spokesman for Marine Corps Forces Central Command said it had not been determined how many Marines, if any, would be called as formal parties to the investigation. Marines called as parties have the right to be represented by counsel in the hearings.
Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Chessani was ordered to stand trial following a review of allegations against him by Lieutenant General James Mattis, the commander of the Marine Corps Forces Central Command, a statement said.
The decision to forward the charges against the two Marines to courts-martial was made by Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis, the commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command. Mattis followed the recommendation of the Marine officer who had presided over the evidentiary hearing for Chessani, but went against the advice of the investigator who had examined the evidence in Tatum's case and later recommended dismissing all charges.
The Corps will convene the court of inquiry at Camp Lejeune to investigate the March 4 shooting on a road in Nangahar province, the Marine Corps Forces Central Command said. The Marines last used the administrative fact-finding process in 1956 to investigate a drill sergeant who marched a group of recruits into a South Carolina creek, where six died.
Mattis is being called because he referred charges against Chessani when he was both commander of the Marine Corps Forces Central Command, and the commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. Mattis has since been promoted to a four- star general and serves as commander of both NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation and commander of U.S. Joint Forces.
Lt. Gen. Samuel Helland, the commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command, the officer who made the two decisions that were announced on Monday, decided against pursuing unpremeditated murder charges against Wuterich, a graver charge than voluntary manslaughter. Helland also dismissed two other charges: soliciting another to commit an offense, and making a false official statement.
Marine Corps spokesman Lt. Col. Sean Gibson said Friday the findings of the Court of Inquiry are classified. The report on their investigation of the March 2006 incident was filed with the office of Lt. Gen. Samuel Helland, commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command.
The retrenchment was sparked by problems afflicting subprime lenders such as New Century Corp., which filed for bankruptcy on April 2 when it couldn't raise capital because of rising defaults among borrowers. The downward spiral caused dozens of subprime lenders and brokers to close or sell to larger companies. Freddie Mac, one of the nation's largest sources of mortgage funds, also said it would no longer purchase the most risky subprime loans.
The credit crunch has already claimed dozens of mortgage companies that have either gone out of business or filed for bankruptcy protection, including American Home Mortgage in New York and New Century Corp. of California, since defaults among borrowers of subprime mortgages first began climbing last year.

In Demichelis's absence, Bosnia's Hasan Salihamidzic could pull back into defence allowing a midfield spot for Andreas Ottl.
Hitzfeld will also be without midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has a bruised thigh, and Andreas Ottl, muscle strain.
Super sub Hamit Altintop then struck with 10 minutes remaining before fellow replacement Andreas Ottl sealed the win which means Bayern top the league and have now scored seven goals without reply from their first two games.

Hospitals have an added legal obligation to protect patient records. But when DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta started monitoring its staff use of Web-based e-mail, it found that doctors and nurses routinely forwarded confidential medical records to their personal Web mail accounts -- not for nefarious purposes, but so they could continue to work from home.
The FBI's biometric database, which includes criminal history records, communicates with the Terrorist Screening Center's database of suspects and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, which is the FBI's master criminal database of felons, fugitives and terrorism suspects.
Benjamin said she and Wright, who resigned as a senior diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Mongolia in 2003, planned to protest at the Canadian embassy in Washington on Thursday and to ask the FBI to remove the protest charges from the NCIC database.
We recognize that in any organization the size of the FBI some weapons will inevitably be stolen or go missing. However, it is important that the FBI take appropriate steps to minimize these losses. When losses occur, the FBI must timely report the loss, be able to identify the contents of lost laptops, and determine whether the laptop is encrypted. In addition, the FBI must investigate these losses and thefts, enter required data into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), and report the losses to DOJ as required.

"New York thinking applied to nature equals paranoia," said Augusten Burroughs, the author of the memoir "Running with Scissors," from his country house on the outskirts of Amherst, Mass., which he and his partner, Dennis Pilsits, built three years ago. Since then, Burroughs, 42, has poured several book advances into what he calls his "prison in the trees" in an effort to defend his rustic outpost "from nature in all its malicious glory." This includes installing an $8,000 lightning protection system and spending $2,000 on various military-grade "tactical illumination devices" -- flashlights -- and even a pair of night-vision goggles, thanks to some terrifying encounters with nocturnal neighbors.
WALPOLE, Mass. - It was a picture-perfect day, and US Senator John F. Kerry drove to this suburb to stand with town leaders and residents as they celebrated the expansion of a medical manufacturing plant.
"You really have to limit your exposure to them because they're so volatile," said Doug Wheat, a financial planner at High Ridge Financial Planning in Northampton, Mass., who specializes in socially responsible investing and once worked in the fuel cell business. He added that most of these companies were small, and many in the clean energy space were dependent on government subsidies, which can change based on the political climate.

This was the time, every second Saturday of July, when the past upstages the present. Semifinals of the Jimmy Van Alen Cup, the lone grass-court presentation of the ATP Tour in the US, went on as billed. But for a day, a glorious, sunny, and seabreezy afternoon, the tournament was overshadowed by the Fame Class of '07, appearing to collect their reward for bygone greatness. (Other than Adams, a 77-year-old Reading, Mass., resident continuing his photographic artistry, they are out of the tennis business.)
Doucoure, who took gold in Helsinki at the 2005 World Championships, is one of the biggest stars in Munich and having captured the European crown at last summer's event in Malaga, France will face some stiff competition.

In November 2005, Fulton County health officials said seven of the eight residents infected that year lived within one mile of a combined sewer overflow facilities or streams that receive a mix of storm water and backed-up sewage.
According to the book deal, signed in May and included in a Fulton County court file, Penguin Group agreed to pay $1.2 million plus royalties to the company that controls rights to the work of Mrs. King's husband, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Another $200,000 would go to the Rev. Barbara Reynolds, a journalist-turned-minister who taped conversations with Mrs. King before her death in January 2006.
Now, if you're like most of us, you don't know a lot about Zachary Harris Johnson. He's a little better known around the boroughs of Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett, for three years ago he won the BellSouth Classic at Sugarloaf. That hardly made him nationally famous. Mild, modest, just like some kid out of "Music Man," the story of Mason City.
"I work with Fulton and Cobb counties and we've take in injured pit bulls all the time and we've adopted a lot of them out to good homes," said the veterinarian, Michael Good, who heads up the Homeless Pets Foundation. "It is the nature of the breed to be very loving toward people. They are a very subservient breed. They are intelligent and they respond to man's affection."
The voter ID law also may have a significant effect on urban voters, especially in metro Atlanta. About 75,000 registered voters in Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Cobb and Clayton counties many not have photo IDs. That's 38 percent of those identified by the state as possibly not having identification. About 13 percent of the state's voters who might not have IDs live in the 5th Congressional District of U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Atlanta), which includes parts of Clayton, Fulton and DeKalb.
Last month Morrow officers, along with Clayton and Fulton sheriff's deputies, raided the warehouse and confiscated 81,000 CDs and recording equipment. They also impounded a BMW valued at $65,000 and a tricked-out van with huge images of Drama and Donald Cannon - professional moniker D.J. Don Cannon - on the sides.
A potentially explosive dispute is taking shape over a proposal to break Fulton County in two and split off Atlanta's predominantly white, affluent suburbs to the north from some of the metropolitan area's poorest, black neighborhoods.
"I really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling," said Ball, 44, who now teaches at William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri.
The TB patient, who is being confined at Grady under a federal isolation order - with an armed guard outside his hospital room - has told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he specifically told Fulton County health officials he was planning to leave for his wedding in Greece, then a honeymoon tour of Europe. He says they only told him they "preferred" he not travel. When pressed on what that meant, the man said they didn't say he couldn't travel.
At one time, ethanol was of particular interest to Czub. Around 2001, he helped promote corn-based ethanol as an alternative biofuel and had been in talks with developers of a soon-to-open plant near Fulton, N.Y.

MTR Corporation, the company running Hong Kong's underground rail network, is hoping to cash in on the boom with a giant shopping centre beside Tsim Sha Tsui, to be called Elements.
The merger of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) with the Kowloon- Canton Railway (KCR) was an important milestone in the railway development of Hong Kong, said Henry Tang, chief secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, at a ceremony here marking the event.
The MTR Corporation said it would use its expertise in running a successful system in Hong Kong to improve the management of London's railway operations after London's mayor said Tuesday that its UK joint venture, MTR Laing, had won the franchise, worth 1.39 billion dollars US.
Five years ago, he turned up at the annual general meeting for local rail operator MTR Corp. and hammered company execs with more than 30 questions, local media said. Then he took a platform reserved for the company's outgoing chairman and offered to give press interviews.
Leading the day's gains was MTR Corp., which jumped 7.3 percent. MTR "is the single largest developer in Hong Kong in terms of land bank," said Pang.
They said China Mobile, property stocks and oil counters led the declines, while HSBC, Hutchison Whampoa and MTR Corp provided some support to the key index.

"Buyings of foreign investors supported the Thai market to outperform other regional stocks which mostly closed lower today," said Adisak Kammool, a senior market analyst at KGI Securities.
"The confidence crisis in Thailand has taken a toll on other regional stocks. All bluechips lost ground because of increasing uncertainties," said Adisak Kammool, a senior market analyst at KGI Securities.
"The index dropped slightly on profit taking ahead of the long holiday weekend. There was selective buying and selling of big- cap stocks in energy, banking and telecom stocks," said Adisak Kammool, a senior stock analyst at KGI Securities.
"The market is likely to slip further next week. The main factor is that fears of a global recession are likely to mount," said Adisak Kammool, head of research at KGI (Thailand) Securities.
Adisak Kammool, head of research at KGI Securities said the Thai market fell Monday in contrast to other regional markets, as foreign investors attempted to deal with global instability.

Bisher al-Rawi, a 37-year-old Iraqi national and British resident, was released from the camp in April after five years in detention. But British officials only took up his case after it was disclosed he had assisted MI5, Britain's domestic spy agency.
Bisher al-Rawi, who moved to England as a teenager after fleeing Saddam Hussein's Iraq, reportedly served as an intelligence source to Britain's MI5 domestic spy agency and helped it keep track of Abu Qatada, a Muslim cleric in London accused of being Osama bin Laden's "ambassador in Europe."
El-Banna was detained in Gambia in 2002, along with British resident Bisher al-Rawi.
The two men -- Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil el-Banna -- were detained in Gambia in 2002 following evidence supplied to the United States. They were taken first to Afghanistan, then to the US-run camp in Cuba where el-Banna is still held.
Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi national and British resident, had been held at the U.S. military base in Cuba since it opened in 2002, but was reunited with his family in south London this weekend.
El-Banna's friend Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi living in Britain, was helping MI5 keep tabs on London's Muslim community.
El-Banna was detained in Gambia in 2002 with British resident Bisher al-Rawi.
George Brent Mickum IV, a Washington lawyer who represents Guantanamo Bay detainees, said he has learned from a former interrogator at the facility that U.S. officials kept an index listing all the videotapes of the foreign delegations. He also said that one of his clients -- Bisher al-Rawi, who was returned to England from Guantanamo Bay -- was interviewed by Britain's MI-5 intelligence service at least five times at the facility, conversations Mickum says would show that Rawi should not have been imprisoned.
The report looks at America's rendition policy and the degree to which the British and intelligence agencies cooperated with it. It examines in more depth the case of Jamil el-Banna and Bisher al-Rawi. The two were arrested by the CIA in Gambia, in 2002, on the basis of information provided by the British intelligence service, even though the British said clearly that they should not be arrested. "The case shows a lack of regard, on the part of the U.S., for U.K. concerns," the committee says.
Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi held at the US base at Guantanamo Bay for nearly five years, said Sunday his "nightmare is finally at an end" in a statement issued after he returned to Britain, where he lives.
Teather aided the release of Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi national and British resident, and Palestinian-Jordanian Jamil el-Banna, who lived in London before his detention.
Unbeknownst to el-Banna, his friend Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi living in Britain, was helping MI5 keep tabs on London's Muslim community.
The other writ was filed on behalf of Libyan Omar Deghayes and Jordanian Jamil el-Banna -- both released in December -- and Iraqi Bisher al-Rawi, released last year.
Banna, a Jordanian, and Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi, are not British citizens but have the right to reside in Britain. Six other British residents are also believed held at the Guantanamo camp in Cuba.
Bisher al-Rawi has been held at the military base since 2002.
Bisher al-Rawi also spoke of the "hopelessness" and "extreme isolation" suffered by detainees at the US military base in Cuba and asked to be granted time with relatives to come to terms with his "horrific experience".
Mugabe himself fathered two children with his secretary before his first wife died. He married Grace Marufu in 1996, and said later his first wife condoned his affair with Marufu because she knew she was barren.

Other members of the Class of 1958 include former academy superintendent Charles Larson, retired astronaut Bruce McCandless and John Poindexter, a national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a figure in the Iran-Contra scandal.
``There may be four or five African novelists who survive just by their writing, and he's probably the only one who doesn't do academic stints,'' says Charles Larson, the American University professor who has chronicled the rise of African literature for 40 years. ``I saw him in India last year at a conference, at this exotic, five-star, 14th-century palace, and at the end of every day, he went back to his room and wrote. He works at it every single day, no matter where he is.''

Democratic candidate Barack Obama used the remark to jab at McCain for his views on the U.S. economy. Campaigning in Chester, Virginia, Obama told voters, "I guess if you think being rich means you've got to make $5 million and if you don't know how many houses you have, it's not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong."
In Britain, the Transport and General Workers' Union expected several thousand people to back a demonstration in Chester, near a factory at Broughton in Wales.
From the very start, he said, "there was not even a thread of doubt in my mind" that he and his brother were never really considered to be suspects -- even after the government held up his citizenship application, put him on a "no-fly" list and summarily revoked his elderly mother's visa, which forced the family to leave its home in Chester, Pennsylvania.
"I guess ... if you don't know how many houses you have, then it's not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong," Obama told an audience in Chester, Va. "But if you're like me, and you've got one house, or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they don't lose their home, you might have a different perspective."
Spokeswomen for Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort in Chester, West Virginia, said they know too little about the plan to comment.

"Every season has a different story, and if it wasn't for the last six weeks or so, it would have been a very disappointing season," Owen said last Wednesday in a telephone interview from his home outside Chester, England, just over the border in Wales. "The team was not playing well, and it wasn't very enjoyable. But when you're winning, you enjoy the game more, you get on with people better and appreciate your teammates more. The last six weeks, with a new manager, have been a big lift in confidence. We've gone on a fantastic run. With that, there's now a feel-good factor."

Arneault is sort of the Walt Disney of the racetrack/casino world. He turned a losing facility into the thriving Mountaineer Racetrack and Gaming Resort in Chester, W.Va. Mountaineer was the first track to install video lottery machines, in June 1990, and Arneault was instrumental in bringing slot machines to Mountaineer in 1994. The following year, when Arneault was named CEO, he took the "racino" from a $5.2 million loss to a $34.9 million profit in 2000. Now there are more than 40 racinos in 12 states.

Authorities believe they know the victims' identities from the other remains, and that they were on the list of missing in the Aug. 1 collapse, said Andrew Baker, chief medical examiner for Hennepin County. They were not immediately identified.
Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said the dive team had been able to penetrate most of what's called the debris field, the area where the bridge's deck collapsed. There are a few of those spots left to penetrate, after which "some debris may have to be removed significantly before we make additional recoveries," Stanek said.
One person who had been feared missing turned up safe at work, officials said. Officials said early in the day that only eight people were missing, but Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek cautioned at an afternoon news conference that the toll could still rise because the number of victims underwater was still unknown.

Crews continued to pull vehicles from the water Thursday to get them out of the way of the recovery operation. Four vehicles retrieved Wednesday had been previously searched, and the occupants had been accounted for, the Hennepin County sheriff's office said in a news release.
Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson issued the temporary restraining order at the players' request, saying he wanted more time to hear arguments in the case. No further hearing date immediately was set.
Weary law enforcement authorities expressed frustration Thursday at the pace of the search for missing victims, but the uncertain conditions left no choice but to move "slowly and deliberately," said Rich Stanek, the Hennepin County sheriff. Families of the missing people made desperate pleas, showing the authorities photographs of their loved ones and reciting license plate numbers and car models to look for.
The state law was actively enforced during Prohibition, when "people would go into bars and dig out drunks and give them a $20 and try to buy their vote," said Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, who said he did not know of any other modern abuses.

The right lesson from the turmoil is that banks must reward bankers who earn profits on a multi-year horizon. They must reform their incentives so that they become more like hedge funds. Politicians can call for this, and regulators can prod helpfully. But the banks' big shareholders will have to drive the process. The rejuvenation of capitalism must come from the capitalists themselves. Mallaby is a fellow for International Economics with the Council on Foreign Relations
The growth of U.S. government need not be an economic disaster. Sweden and Denmark combine large public sectors with fast growth in GDP per capita. But to get away with big government, you must have smart government. Once the financial crisis is behind us, this should be the guiding principle of the Obama years. Mallaby is a fellow for International Economics with the Council on Foreign Relations
So it's great that the world wants to act on global warming, and it's remarkable how fast the mood has changed. But we are a long way from clarity and honesty. As deadlocked trade diplomacy tells us, it's one thing for the nations of the world to declare that they want action. Brokering the compromises that make action possible is altogether harder. Mallaby is a fellow for International Economics with the Council on Foreign Relations
How this plays out is anybody's guess. The same bug-eyed panic that was evident among bankers last month has seized traders of emerging-market currencies. The really scary thing is that the crisis has migrated into parts of the financial system that are tough to rescue. When push came to shove, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and their European counterparts could stand behind the banking system. But now we are talking about hedge funds, which lie beyond the traditional reach of regulators, and emerging markets, some of whose governments lack the cash to stage bailouts. Unlike your standard horror movie, there's no telling when this one will end. Mallaby is a fellow for International Economics with the Council on Foreign Relations
The collapse of Fannie and Freddie's share prices presents an opportunity to buy them on the cheap.

In European capitals these days, the anti-Americanism that flared up with the Iraq war is joined by a new schadenfreude. Americans thought they could splash money on foreign policy adventures and 50-inch TVs; now a nation fueled by debt is facing its comeuppance. But surely at least some foreigners can see the tragic dimension here. The United States went into Iraq because, even if mistakenly, it wanted to rid the world of a menace. For this, the world hated it. The United States is throwing money at its economic difficulties because it sees a threat to its prosperity and also to the wider world. For this, the world scorns it. Investors are responding to America's economic activism by dumping dollars the way they once dumped dot-com stocks. The would-be saviors of the world economy can no longer afford lunch in Europe.

That said, the sequence in which Kale dispatches his antic buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to poke around Mr. Turner's garage armed with a video camera culminates in a funny mini-satire of Asian horror.
Directed by D.J. Caruso; written by Carl Ellsworth and Christopher Landon; starring Shia LaBeouf, David Morse, Carrie- Anne Moss and Sarah Roemer
"Disturbia" will never be accused of undue originality, but its adherence to genre conventions works in its favor. Instead of manufacturing elaborate, ridiculous plot twists or imposing overwrought psychological melodrama on a basically absurd premise, Caruso and the screenwriters, Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth, opt for efficient, clever B-movie execution. There are no big surprises, but the jumps and jolts are well timed and the overall mood is at once grisly and good-natured -- more diverting than disturbing.
But star Shia LaBeouf, while no Jimmy Stewart, certainly works up a good, convincing head of pervy paranoia as a delinquent peeper who convinces himself that one of his neighbors is a murderer. Writers Christopher Landon ("Another Day in Paradise") and Carl Ellsworth ("Red Eye") give LaBeouf's Kale more backstory than needed. We see how a horrific accident killed his father when he was behind the wheel, which makes his later antisocial behavior more forgivable than a braver movie might need it to be.
My main gripe is that the filmmakers -- director D.J. Caruso, who put the macho mojo in "Two for the Money," and screenwriters Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth -- made no effort to drum up some semi-logical explanation for not bringing in the law. As in, I don't know -- the cat ate my cell phone? Maybe lightning storms downed every power line in 80 miles. Or the entire police department ate tainted escargot. It could happen.
"The PKK must be eliminated as a problem between Iraq and Turkey," Turkey's special envoy to Iraq, Oguz Celikkol, told CNN- Turk television on Wednesday after visiting Baghdad this week.

Cewang Rigzin, the "TYC" president, said at a meeting on March 20 that violence has "achieved its goal" to "awaken resistance among people in Tibet and attract high-profile international attention to the Tibet issue" but the struggle "will not stop and this incident is just the prelude of this year's fight."
A campaign team headed by Cewang Rigzin, president of the secessionist TYC, then started to collect funds and initiated a four-step action plan, including provocative activities such as organized protests.
"Now you want to tell me that we got a fair shake today?" said Charles Bounds, whose 56-year-old wife, Mary, was kidnapped from a church and killed by Berry in 1987.
"The Taiwanese media outlets that have reporters stationed in Beijing should not have been excluded from the news conference, " ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said, adding that the ATJ will issue a formal statement calling for its counterparts in other countries to help defend Taiwanese reporters' right to cover the riots.
The U.N. has refused to issue the press passes since 2004 on the grounds that Taiwan is not a U.N. member and is thus not allowed to enter any U.N. building, ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said at the congress.
Chen Hsiao-yi, president of the Association of Taiwan Journalists, for her part, said that the news environment in Taiwan is comparatively free compared with that of some other countries.

MILAN, Italy -- Every few weeks, one of a group of Tunisians would wire funds to a city in Europe or the Middle East, attracting little attention because the sums were small. But Italian officials broke up the ring after finding the money was allegedly being used to recruit and train Islamic extremists. Italian officials call it terrorism on the cheap: Sums so small they apparently elude programs that track terrorist financing. ON THE CHEAP. Moved. By Victor L. Simpson.

"I don't know how I can make a case that all the children in Colorado City are in danger," Goddard said.
In the deeply isolated polygamist communities of Hildale, Utah, and nearby Colorado City, Ariz., about an hour southeast of St. George, residents said the verdict would probably just harden the lines of resistance.
How much control Jeffs had over the girl is crucial to the outcome of the case, which has drawn international attention to the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist community based in the adjacent towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., about 50 miles east of St. George.
Texas authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the alleged husband, a man identified as Dale Barlow of Colorado City, Arizona, one of two communities on the Utah-Arizona border that have been the traditional home base of the secretive church.
Most members of his Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints live in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah -- in Washington County -- and Colorado City, Arizona. The sect split from mainstream Mormonism after the broader church renounced polygamy in 1890.
"They don't depend on the outside world; they are very self- contained," Shannon Price, director of Diversity Foundation, a group that helps boys who have been pushed out of the FLDS communities in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz. Price spent several days in Eldorado advising Texas officials. She said she told them that the children would be comfortable with "fundamental toys, very hands-on, involving lots of dexterity."
Jeffs succeeded his father in 2002 as president of the FLDS, who since the 1920s have lived in the twin towns of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona.
Jeffs' group -- based in the adjacent towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona -- numbers about 10,000. It is cloaked in secrecy and widely known for marrying off teenage brides and banishing men and boys who disagree with Jeffs. The Mormon Church renounced polygamy in 1890 and has disavowed any connection to the sect.
Those objectives included wresting control of a $114 million (euro72.65 million) church property trust from church leaders; ousting some members of the police department in the church- controlled border towns of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah; and helping law enforcers locate victims of child abuse willing to testify against Jeffs.
Utah authorities say officers in tiny Colorado City, Arizona, are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and are more loyal to its leader, Warren Jeffs, than to their badges and their oath of office.
The Fontainebleau was a decadent paradise of "flashy diamonds, illicit sex and overflowing ice cream sodas," she said. To get to her family's cabana, "you had to walk through the downstairs shops and past a dance studio where they had all these gorgeous guys giving cha-cha lessons to all these overdressed matrons from Scarsdale."
In addition to his wife of 47 years, Wachtel is survived by a son, Philip Wachtel of Scarsdale, and two grandchildren.
"I know it's not nice to say, but I absolutely couldn't be happier," said Young, a founder of Renee Young &amp; Associates, a public relations firm in Scarsdale, N.Y. "I have more time for work, more time for play, more money in my pocket, more food in my fridge, more clean towels and more gas in my car!"
The gambling operators in the metropolitan area made tribute payments to two of the Luchese family's top bosses in New York, Joseph DiNapoli, of Scarsdale, and Matthew Madonna, of Selden, both 72, according to Milgram. Sometimes, debtors were forced to take loans at annual interest rates exceeding 200 percent. Some debtors were even forced to refinance their homes.
Luski, a real-estate investor from Scarsdale, N.Y., made up for his faux pas, buying a pair of the late president's unused skis for $14,000 and thousands of dollars of other items, ranging from various bric-a-brac to two presentation-quality American flags to equip his second home in Beaver Creek.
Morgan was born in New York City on May 7, 1932. As a child during World War II, he and his brother published a hand-typeset magazine called The Fresh Egg from the family's chicken farm in Scarsdale, N.Y. Filled with articles by relatives and friends living abroad that described a war-ravaged Europe, the magazine was distributed to neighbors along with eggs from the farm.
Vicenta Rodriguez Lopez lives in Severance, about 60 miles north of Denver. She's leaving for the Mexican state of Sinaloa after 15 years because her husband, who worked at a ranch dairy, was deported for being here illegally.
Later, the officials said they had evidence that the shipment belonged to traffickers in a cartel controlled by Joaquin Guzman, one of Mexico's most wanted criminals. Guzman, called El Chapo, or Shorty, is one of a group of traffickers from Sinaloa known as the Federation. They control the border crossings near Ciudad Juarez.
They tracked Weir to the town of Brawley, east of San Diego, where they think he slipped into Mexico, possibly to the states of Sinaloa or Michoacan. Weir has family in Mexico and speaks Spanish fluently, police said.
Police found the three bodies with their hands bound in El Huajote, a town in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, Mexican newspapers Reforma and El Universal reported, citing the state Attorney General's office.
ACAPULCO, Mexico -- A video purportedly showing the beheading of a drug cartel hit man appears on a popular video-sharing Web site, and its makers call on Mexicans to kill more members of the gang. The video appears as the rival Gulf and Sinaloa gangs wage a bloody battle for trafficking routes and President Felipe Calderon is taking on organized crime with thousands of troops sent to drug-plagued areas.

At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), Henriette was centered about 95 kilometers (60 miles) west-southwest of Los Mochis on the Mexican mainland and it was moving north at 20 kph (13 mph). Hurricane warnings were posted from Topolobampo in Sinaloa state north to Bahia Kino. From there, it was expected to weaken over Mexico's deserts and dump an inch or two of rain on southwest New Mexico Thursday.
Recently, the neighboring state of Sinaloa has been shocked by a wave of violence that has taken the lives of many innocents, including another 12-year-old girl. Authorities said Tuesday that more than 1,200 additional federal police were deployed to Sinaloa as part of a nationwide government offensive involving about 40,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police officers.
Malverde is widely considered the patron saint of drug dealers, say law enforcement officials and experts on Mexican culture. A shrine has been erected atop his grave in the remote city of Culiacan in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, which has long been associated with opium and marijuana trafficking.
Other monks' protests were held Tuesday in Yangon and Bago, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the north. The monks in Yangon found themselves locked out of three pagodas, including the Shwedagon, before they finished a 16 kilometer (10 mile) march, which attracted as many as 3,000 onlookers. Some journalists covering the march had their cameras confiscated by the authorities.
Witnesses said about 50 people, wearing white, marched Monday in the bustling township of Bago, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the country's commercial center, Yangon.

The Democratic edge in the current Congress is 235-199 with one vacancy in a formerly Democratic seat. Two Louisiana seats, one Democratic and one Republican, won't be decided until December because hurricanes postponed their primaries until Tuesday.
The administration is in regular contact with Louisiana's Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, a Democrat. Jindal has said he will skip the convention because of the storm. Nagin, widely criticized in 2005 for not evacuating his city before Katrina blasted in, left this week's Democratic National Convention early to return home. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has held up his plans to go to Minnesota.
FEMA has made moderate improvements in its ability to deploy critical supplies, such as water, to disaster-stricken communities since its poor showing in the massive 2005 hurricane that almost destroyed New Orleans, Louisiana, the agency's inspector general concluded in a report to be released Thursday at a Senate Homeland Security hearing. The agency has more work ahead, including development of plans to house disaster victims and improved training for its employees.
In Oklahoma, where 23 of the deaths have occurred, hardest hit was McAlester, where many stores were operating on generator power. Ice coated power lines throughout much of the city and nearly 1,000 linemen, tree-trimmers and support workers from the states of Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and Tennessee were there Wednesday to repair the damage.
A weather system with the potential to become a tropical storm appeared to be heading toward the U.S. state of Louisiana, prompting emergency officials to be on guard Wednesday. Shell Oil Co. announced evacuation plans for hundreds of staff from its rigs in the region.
Evacuation orders were also issued for Jefferson and Orange counties, between Houston and the Louisiana state line.
The company, which is set to decide Friday whether to build a new US$2.9 billion (euro2 billion) plant in Alabama or in Louisiana, said sales rose 11 percent to euro13.1 billion (US$17.72 billion) in the quarter, compared with euro11.7 billion last year.
It could be a day or more before oil and natural gas companies can assess the damage to their drilling and refining installations. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said as much as 20 percent of oil and gas production that was stopped because of Gustav could be restored by this weekend, stressing that it was a rough estimate.
Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin asked Gonzales when the Justice Department planned to indict Democratic Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana. Two associates have pleaded guilty to paying him for allegedly providing them illegal assistance in procuring government contracts. Gonzales wouldn't discuss the case.
Many lawmakers are angry that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales hasn't resigned, but Rep. William Jefferson has reason to be grateful. Justice Department officials Monday unveiled corruption charges that could land the Louisiana Democrat in prison for 235 years. But in their news conference on the seventh floor of the Justice Department, the officials found themselves laboring to escape the image of politicization that a months-long scandal over Gonzales's hiring and firing of prosecutors has given the department.
Yet after almost two years of federal inspections and studies and reviews filling more than 90 pages, the administration building has neither been repaired nor replaced. And there are dozens of similarly incomplete projects at the park, hundreds in the city, thousands across the state of Louisiana.
But that pattern could ease during the waning days of his term. People close to the process say that lawyers with political connections increasingly have approached the White House directly to seek relief for their high-profile clients, including former junk-bond king Michael Milken, former congressman Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R-Calif., and former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards.

"The situation in the hard hit areas of Pisco and Ica remains difficult for the thousands of families who lost their homes and belongings in the disaster," said Giorgio Ferrario, the federation's representative in the Peruvian capital, Lima.
A total of 35,000 homes were destroyed in the magnitude 8.0 temblor (7.7 on the Richter scale) that heaved across southern Peru on Wednesday, most of them in Pisco, which was 70 percent destroyed.
On the same day, a Bolivian air force plane loaded with 11 tons of aid materials arrived in the hardest-hit city of Pisco, about 200 km southeast of Lima.
The center of the destruction was in Peru's southern desert, in the oasis city of Ica and the nearby port of Pisco, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Lima.
The center of the destruction was in Peru's southern desert, in the oasis city of Ica and the nearby port of Pisco, about 125 miles southeast of the capital, Lima. Pisco's mayor said at least 200 people were buried in the rubble of a church where they had been attending a service.
A powerful earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale struck the Peruvian Pacific Coast on Aug. 15, devastating hospitals, schools, churches and government buildings in the city of Pisco, and seriously affecting the capital Lima and other cities.
Bolivian President Evo Morales toured Peru's quake-ravaged port of Pisco, meeting with Peru's leader and delivering 59 metric tons (65 tons) of water and medicine to victims.
Teams dug beneath the rubble in the cities of Pisco and Ica and the nearby town of Chincha, all situated near the epicenter of the magnitude 8.0 quake south of the capital, Lima. The damage and casualties appeared to be concentrated in those three communities, which also lost power and telephone service.

Military trucks carrying supplies were swarmed Saturday by dozens of people in the port city of Pisco, and survivors fought over cans of tuna and cartons of milk. In a soccer stadium, more than 500 people lined up at a lone truck that passed out packets of crackers, candy and toilet paper. When the food ran out, people rushed the truck screaming that they had not yet eaten.
The recently-formed business alliance involves major Australian companies such as ANZ Bank, Grey Global Group, IAG, Pfizer and Visy Industries.
Insurance Australia Group was up 0.3 percent at 3.99 a day after its chief executive Michael Hawker resigned following shareholder discontent arising from IAG's rejection last week of a merger proposal from global insurer QBE.
"You will see competitors' answer to the iPhone somewhere in the next year or so," said Roger Entner, senior vice president of IAG Research's communications sector. "I'm sure every competitor on the market will be buying one of these to rip it apart and see how they can do the same thing."
Recent flooding in New South Wales put the pressure on the insurers, with IAG down 0.07 at 5.90 while competitors AMP slipped 0.03 to 10.04 and QBE fell 0.10 to 31.05.
Australian-listed global insurance group QBE Insurance said Monday it had lifted its offer for the nation's second-largest general insurer, Insurance Australia Group (IAG), and declared the offer final.
General insurer Insurance Australia Group (IAG) closed flat at 3.99 after its board on Tuesday rejected a takeover proposal from global insurer QBE Insurance, which rose 0.6 percent to 25.32.
"They got it done and they did it with class," he said, wearing a blue Colts cap and T-shirt over camouflage pants while watching the post-game show in a conference room decorated with strategic maps at the IAG headquarters.
The chief executive of general insurer Insurance Australia Group (IAG) resigned Monday amid shareholder anger after the company rejected a 8.7 billion dollar (8.36 billion US) takeover bid.
The finance sector was boosted by QBE Insurance's 7.9-billion- dollar share and cash offer for IAG, which the latter rejected. IAG surged 8.6 percent to 4.19 dollars and QBE closed down 1.3 percent at 22.90.
Dealers said poor results from Insurance Australia Group (IAG) and Centro Properties Group also hurt market sentiment.
"It will be interesting to see if they announce anything at CTIA," said Roger Entner, a senior vice president at IAG Research.
The union wants higher wages for outsourced workers, plus a one- off payment of 250,000 forint (929 euros, 1,245 dollars) for every employee, to be paid out of the 10.5 billion forint in proceeds from MAV's sale of its freight transport union MAV Cargo.
Austrian national railway OEBB said Wednesday it would finalize its acquisition of Hungarian rail shipping company MAV Cargo -- a euro400 million (US$584 million) deal that marks the Austrian company's international debut.
The union claims rail employees are owed the lump sum after the government pledged to share the proceeds from the January sale of MAV Cargo, the rail company's shipping subsidiary.
OeBB, Austria's state-run rail operator, has won the race to acquire MAV Cargo, the freight arm of Hungarian state railway MAV, the Hungarian economy ministry announced on Tuesday.
The Hungarian government signed Wednesday the contract selling MAV Cargo, the freight arm of state railway MAV, to Rail Cargo Austria and Austro-Hungarian company GYSEV.
Daniel Igali, the national wrestling coach Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) in Lagos on Wednesday informed the local sports radio station that the country was culpable of the plight.
Forty-five Nigerian wrestlers who have been under-going intensive camping in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, ahead of the Ninth All Africa Games in Algeria, are all hoping to grab a medal or two during the Games, a top official of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) has said.
After the country's dismal outing at the Olympic Games in Beijing, the Nigeria Weightlifting Federation (NWF) plans an Inter-Club Championships to keep weightlifters in form.
Steve Olarinoye, secretary of the Nigeria Weightlifting Federation (NWF), is confident that the country's weightlifters will be at the Beijing Olympics in August.
"We're initiating legal action because invasive species are killing the Great Lakes," said Andy Buchsbaum of the NWF. "The threat is urgent, the solution is clear and the law is straight- forward."

Today, the Fords represent just one faction in Memphis politics, said political scientist Bruce Oppenheimer at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. And it's a far-from-unified faction. In 2002, Ophelia unsuccessfully challenged her brother Josephfor a Shelby County commission seat. Last year, when Jake ran for Harold Jr.'s former congressional seat, some family members backed his opponent.
Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said the question was not so much whether Obama would carry Mississippi, but whether he would force Republicans to spend time and money in the state.

The crew members -- American Suni Williams and two Russians, Cmdr. Fyodor Yurchikhin and Flight Engineer Oleg Kotov -- answered questions from British-born NASA astronaut C. Michael Foale, who stood beside the queen. The video link at the flight center was one-way, so the crew members could not see the queen standing by silently.
Investor-philanthropist Alan D. Solomont of Weston, who chaired Obama's prolific fund-raising effort in New England, said he will help others who were active find administration jobs but plans to stay in Massachusetts himself. He said he will continue to serve on the board that oversees AmeriCorps and other national service programs that Obama has pledged to expand dramatically. Solomont, 59, and a veteran of six presidential campaigns, was appointed by Bill Clinton and reappointed by Bush.
Kathleen Shepard, 59, a real estate agent from Weston, Mass., started waking up at 3 a.m., worrying about the direction of the country - the economy, the dependence on foreign oil. She wanted to influence the election, but living in liberal Massachusetts, she knows her vote is unlikely to change the electoral math on Election Day. Last week, she said goodbye to her husband, her dog, and her Coldwell Banker office, and flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to campaign for Barack Obama.
Meyer, a senior telecommunications major from the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Weston, has a Web site featuring several homemade videos. In one, he stands in a street with a sign that says "Harry Dies" after the latest Harry Potter book was released. In another, he acts like a drunk in a bar while trying to pick up a man dressed in drag.
Bruce Forest, 50, was charged last year with a series of toilet explosions in 2005 and 2006. But under a plea agreement, he admitted only to blowing up one toilet in Weston in February 2006. No one was injured in any of the blasts, most of which occurred at night in isolated areas.
Then a mayor from Weston in Broward County filed a lawsuit. The ballot language, he argued, would mislead people into thinking they would keep Save Our Homes when they moved.
A couple of hundred fans were on hand in Weston, Fla., in 2006 to see April Carson break the Tequesta Trace Middle School record for 3-pointers in a game. But her father posted an Internet video of the performance, which has been viewed more than 11,000 times by people who have joined that small crowd in watching April sink seven 3-pointers.

The massacre was the country's deadliest school shooting and followed another shooting in November 2007 at a Finnish high school in Jokela, north of Helsinki, in which 18-year-old student Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot six students, the headmistress and a school nurse before killing himself.
Tuesday's massacre was the country's second deadly school shooting in less than a year. In November 2007, an 18-year-old boy killed eight pupils and staff at his upper secondary school in Jokela in southern Finland before turning the gun on himself.
"The violence at the Jokela school center has shocked us to our very core. This unbelievable incident has rendered us speechless in pain and distress," Bishop Mikko Heikka told mourners in Helsinki Cathedral.
In an eerily similar case, 18-year-old student Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot six students, a headmistress and a nurse before killing himself in a school in Jokela, north of Helsinki on November 7, 2007.
According to the online edition of the local newspaper Bergensavisen, the video contained specific references to the Jokela high school massacre in Finland on November 7.
When 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen last November stalked the halls of his high school in Jokela, north of Helsinki, gunning down six students, a headmistress and a nurse before killing himself, Finns were shocked but mainly wrote the tragedy off as a one-time freak occurrence.
The arrest was made two days after 22-year-old Matti Saari killed 10 people and himself at a school in Kauhajoki, western Finland. In November last year, 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen fatally shot eight people and himself in Jokela, near Helsinki.
The shooting came less than a year after a massacre at a Finnish high school in Jokela, north of Helsinki.
Coming less than a year after a massacre at a Finnish high school in Jokela, north of Helsinki, Tuesday's shooting is bound to reopen the debate over gun ownership in Finland.
In an eerily similar attack last November, 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen killed eight people and himself at a school in Jokela, near Helsinki. Six years ago, a 19-year-old chemical engineering student killed six people and himself, injuring 80 others when he detonated a homemade bomb in a crowded shopping mall.
The arrest came only two days after 22-year-old Matti Saari killed 10 people and himself at a school in Kauhajoki, western Finland. In November last year, 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen fatally shot eight people and himself in Jokela, near Helsinki.
The victims of Jokela high school were killed when student Pekka- Eric Auvinen opened fire with a 22-caliber handgun in the middle of the school day. He then shot himself in the head and died late on Wednesday.
The Observer Media Group, which owns the weekly newspaper, and Cablevision, the cable television giant run by the Dolan family, had a face-to-face meeting earlier this week to discuss supplanting Murdoch's offer for Newsday, particularly if Murdoch encounters difficulties with government regulators.
But the agreement is far from final as competing bidders consider their positions. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News, the Post's arch-rival, will make a counter-offer next week, according to people involved in the bidding process who would not be identified because of the confidentiality of the negotiations. Representatives of another bidder, Observer Media Group, publisher of The New York Observer, plan to meet in the next few days with Cablevision -- which had dropped out of the bidding -- to discuss a joint offer.
The Observer Media Group, publisher of The New York Observer, was prepared to bid well over $500 million, but concluded that it could not get into a bidding war with its more deep-pocketed rivals, according to people briefed on that company's plans. Instead, Jared Kushner, owner of Observer Media, tried last week to interest the Dolans in a joint offer.
He has also made his first addition to what is now the Observer Media Group: He bought politicsnj.com a month ago. On March 5 he hired a new editor; over the next days he signed New Jersey's former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former U.S. Sen. Robert G. Torricelli as columnists; and he went live with the site Thursday.

Also on Thursday in Sihanoukville, Cambodian Free Trade Union leader Chea Mony told a workers' rally that entrepreneurs should promote minimum monthly payment per capita from the current 56 U.S. dollars to 75 U.S. dollars because Cambodia is undergoing inflation.
Since the two were convicted of killing Chea Vichea, who had led the opposition- linked Free Trade Union of the Workers of Kingdom of Cambodia, one of the key witnesses in the trial has recanted.
Chea Mony, president of Cambodia's Free Trade Union which has claimed to have 74,000 members, on Tuesday threatened to call a strike against the amendment.
Meanwhile factory owners are looking abroad for greater productivity and lower costs, says Cambodia's Free Trade Union (FTU).
"For Latinos, the immigration marches that occurred in 2006 that were largely organized by young citizens sparked a lot of political activity and fervor," said Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Institute at California State University, Los Angeles.

Charlotte Cooper of Britain had already won three of her five Wimbledon titles when she became the first women's Olympic champion.
But in South Beach alone, the number of people in Jewish households dropped by 53 percent between 1994 and 2004, to 4,171 from 8,775. Charlotte Cooper, who came to Miami Beach from New York to perform Yiddish theater in the 1960s and stayed until she was priced out in 1999, said she could hardly stand to return these days.
They hoped to be done at the scene on Sunday and to store the debris from Friday's crash elsewhere in Phoenix, Arizona, said Steve R. Chealander, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.

NEW HAVEN, Connecticut -- Seasick but awestruck at times, a group of American and British college students are learning the wonders of the sea and the horrors of slavery. The seven students are aboard the Freedom Schooner Amistad, a near-replica of the famous ship that sparked a slave revolt. The ship is crossing the Atlantic for the first time after leaving New Haven in late June for a 16-month, 14,000-mile voyage to Nova Scotia, Britain and Africa that traces a 19th century route of the slave trade.

The Connecticut senator, an independent who was the Democrats' 2000 vice presidential nominee, was scheduled to announce his support for McCain at a town hall meeting Monday morning in Hillsborough, New Hampshire.
Roosevelt's cagey strategy paid off. He swept the nation, carrying 42 states -- only Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Vermont   went Republican. The GOP lost 12 seats in the Senate and more than 100 seats in the House, giving control of both chambers to the Democrats. A sea change had taken place. And the presidential candidate who had suggested severe   budget cuts would go on to spend billions -- a lot of money in the 1930s -- for huge relief and public-works programs.
The defeat of 22-year veteran Rep. Chris Shays in Connecticut gave Democrats every House seat from the northeastern New England states. The victory by Democratic businessman Jim Himes occurred despite Republican Shays' recent highly publicized late criticism of McCain's presidential campaign.
The signs of a potentially big Democratic year can be found from Connecticut, where Rep. Christopher Shays is in danger of losing the last GOP-held House seat in New England, to Alaska, where 35-year House veteran Young, a key player on land issues important to the West, stands to lose his seat.

Harold Brooks, a meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., said there has been a long history of midwinter storms exacting deadly tolls, but the number of deaths is as much a function of chance and location as the number of tornadoes. He said that the biggest midwinter outbreak of twisters on record, on Jan. 21-22, 1999, saw 134 tornadoes altogether, but nine deaths.
In an outbreak in 2002, at least 52 people treated at a pain clinic in Norman, Okla., were infected with hepatitis C after a nurse used the same needle and syringe to give drugs to many patients. In New York City earlier this year, health officials linked three cases of hepatitis C to an anesthesiologist who administered intravenous pain medication. The officials said they would notify 4,500 patients who received treatment from the doctor from December 2003 to May 2007, urging them to get tested.
Cynthia Valenzuela of Norman, Okla., contacted Chase about her credit card in 2004 when her husband fell ill and family bills began piling up. She signed up with an independent credit- counseling program that negotiated a repayment plan with all her creditors that she could afford. It allowed her to make a single monthly payment that would be distributed among them. In 2005, the credit-counseling agency went bankrupt and ceased operations. Valenzuela's creditors agreed to work directly with her, lowering interest rates and agreeing on monthly payments -- all except Chase. The bank told her it would not work with any customer for five years after he or she leaves a debt-management program.
"There are active years and we don't particularly understand why," said research meteorologist Harold Brooks at the National Severe Storms Lab in Norman, Oklahoma.
The Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford arrived in Norman three years ago with modest hype and low expectations. The Sooner staff admitted that they recruited him for depth behind Rhett Bomar, who had been the country's top quarterback recruit.
"There's no trend," said Greg Carbin, of NOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.
Conner and Comaneci own a gymnastics academy in Norman, Okla., but don't do much teaching because they still travel frequently for motivational speaking and promotional and charity work. Comaneci returns to Romania several times a year to keep tabs on business interests and charities there.
Blair has something special to play for as well. If his Aggies beat the Longhorns, A&amp;M will clinch its first Big 12 regular-season title. The Aggies could still end up tied with Oklahoma, if the Sooners beat Baylor later in the evening in Norman. But A&amp;M would clinch the top seed in the conference tournament, thanks to its two victories over OU.
Other rivers and streams swollen by weeks of heavy rainfall may also burst their banks after another round of thunderstorms expected Friday, said Ty Judd, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Norman.
Most remember Oklahoma for its 47-game winning streak from 1953-57, which ended when the Sooners lost to Notre Dame 7-0 in Norman, Okla. Two of those three undefeated seasons ('55 and '56) earned national titles (to go with another from 1950).
"The public placing their trust in me is the greatest, humbling and most awesome experience I've ever had in my life," said Hammons, who is from Muskogee but attends the university in Norman.
HOLLYWOOD, Florida -- The towering piles of books and summertime stream of construction workers give no hint, but this school is like no other. It takes its name from a Jewish high priest. Its director is a rabbi. Hebrew will be uttered throughout. Oh, and it's a public school -- raising concerns it will violate the U.S. political doctrine of the separation of church and state, even though its advocates say its object is to teach Hebrew, not the Jewish religion.

``Toyota is well on the way to being a fully American manufacturer,'' said analyst George Peterson of AutoPacific Inc. in Tustin, Calif. ``It will be able to counter the idea that it may be hurting the domestic manufacturers, by pointing out that it makes its vehicles here and is directly and indirectly responsible for hundreds of thousands of jobs here.''

Schiffman asked that contributions in his daughter's name be sent to Schneider Children's Hospital at North Shore in Manhasset, N.Y., and said that donations would be directed to help teenagers with psychological problems.
A New York Times News Service article about Jesse Friedman, who pleaded guilty in 1988 to committing sex crimes against children in his Long Island home and now says that prosecutors withheld evidence that some of his accusers were hypnotized before testifying before the grand jury that indicted him, misstated part of the professional title of Dr. Sandra Kaplan, who led a team of therapists who treated the children. She is director of the division of trauma psychiatry -- not psychology -- at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset.
Under the agreement signed in June 2006 by President Paul Biya of Cameroon and Nigeria's then president Olusegun Obasanjo at the Greentree estate in Manhasset, New York, Nigeria agreed to withdraw troops from the oil-rich peninsula to fulfill a ruling in 2002 by The Hague-based International Court of Justice, which said the area belonged to Cameroon.

In addition to those three cities, New Delhi, Dhaka, Riyadh, Cairo, Sana'a, Rabat and Dubai will also receive staffing boosts, though Miliband said that numbers for each specific mission had not yet been finalised.
The U.S. president, who flew to Riyadh from Dubai on his eight- day Mideast trip, was to meet with King Abdullah. The king was expected to urge Bush to keep up the pressure on Israel to halt settlements in Palestinian territories. The administration was able to persuade the Saudis to participate in the U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace conference in Annapolis, Md., in November.
Leaders from Algeria, Angola, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have already arrived in Riyadh, the centre of which has been brought to a stand-still because of security arrangements.

In recent months, eight major licensing deals have been struck between oil-rich investors and entertainment giants such as Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment Inc. for theme parks and other attractions.
Lee is no longer associated with Marvel Entertainment Inc., which produces comic books and feature films based on characters he created while employed there.
Marvel Entertainment Inc. recently strengthened its financial position by creating its own film studio, which has enabled it to keep more of the revenue from movies based on its popular characters. Last month the New York-based company said its second-quarter profit surged 61 percent on pre-sales of the movies "Iron Man" and "The Incredible Hulk."
Marvel Studios, a division of Marvel Entertainment Inc., secured $525 million three years ago through Merrill Lynch to venture into feature production after watching its flawed, colorful heroes Spider-Man and X-Men rack up big ticket sales for Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox.
So far this year, Paramount Pictures' "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and "Iron Man" have busted into the $300-million range, and Marvel Entertainment Inc.'s "The Incredible Hulk" is poised to surpass $200 million.
David Maisel, chairman of Marvel Studios, a unit of publicly traded Marvel Entertainment Inc., said that given the success of "Iron Man," it made sense to continue the distribution pact with Paramount on "improved economic terms." By releasing through one worldwide distribution partner, Maisel said Marvel believes it can "maximize the upside" of its movies.

"The broader dislocation in the capital markets has definitely affected the student loan industry," said Tom Graf, executive director of MEFA, a nonprofit state organization. "Clearly there's a trend where ((investors)) are hesitant to enter the market, and it's a nationwide phenomenon."
MEFA's empty coffers sent students and families scrambling to find other loans just as tuition bills were coming due. The authority's private loans have been popular because they were offered at low, fixed rates: Many lenders offer only variable rates, which can rise unpredictably. The loss of MEFA as an option this year could cost families significantly more in interest payments over time.
Last week, responding to pressure from the Legislature, Governor Deval L. Patrick had urged the state pension fund, which Cahill oversees, to invest $50 million in MEFA's planned bond offering.
The proposal would entail the investment funds buying portions of a $425 million bond sale that MEFA is planning this month. The agency would use the proceeds to finance student loans.
With $60,000 in tuition bills due this fall and her husband struggling with cancer, Lynne Tartaglia applied for $33,000 in loans from Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, or MEFA. She received her approval on March 7.
That will affect thousands of Massachusetts students: MEFA made federal loans to 14,700 in the current school year.
Big bills on campus BAD NEWS for 40,000 families hit this week when the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority announced that it could not offer private student loans this year because it had failed to secure financing. Created by the state Legislature in 1982, MEFA provided more than $500 million in loans last year.
In a letter delivered to the governor early Friday, the senators suggested that the administration use its muscle to persuade banks to step in to assist the authority. They also asked Patrick to press wealthy colleges and universities to either invest in MEFA's bonds or to provide backing so the authority can attract investors in the open market.

Softbank gained 2.2 percent to 2,100 yen after agreeing with Oak Pacific Interactive to purchase a 40 percent interest in the Chinese Internet company for about 40 billion yen.
Two weeks ago, Softbank said it hoped to boost its 14 percent stake in a major Chinese Internet company, Oak Pacific Interactive, to 40 percent for a total investment of 40 billion yen (US$385 million, euro247million).

In a world of cramped and unpleasant planes, trains actually may be the last respite of luxury. Sensing this demand, luxury travel companies like Orient-Express have invested in restoring the world's most famous train routes. And travelers are responding by packing new trains.

The second quake struck at 6:49 a.m. Thursday. The USGS said it was centered about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Sumatran city of Bengkulu. It occurred at a depth of about 10 kilometers (six miles).
Associated Press writer Zakki Hakim contributed to this report from Bengkulu.
The quake struck at 9:46 p.m. local time (1446GMT) just off the coast of Bengkulu province, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) west of the capital, Jakarta, the USGS said. It had a depth of around 35 kilometers (21.7 miles).

Havret will make it to Carnoustie next week if he finishes higher than any other player not already qualified. If he does he will be competing where his compatriot Jean van de Velde famously squandered a three-shot lead on the final hole in 1999.
Site: St. Andrews and Carnoustie, Scotland.
The rain and wind were so strong at Carnoustie on Monday morning that Tiger Woods and Rod Pampling didn't even bother with umbrellas, and Woods took off his glove when he lost feeling in his ring finger. By the afternoon, Henrik Stenson sat on the side of the practice range trying to decide which sunglasses to wear.
Woods sank a 90-foot birdie putt Thursday at damp, chilly Carnoustie on his way to a 2-under-par 69, putting himself solidly in contention for his third straight British Open championship.
The tournament at Brown Deer Park Golf Course offers a chance for the PGA Tour's rank and file to shine, while the world's top golfers do battle at the British Open at Carnoustie in Scotland.

Hardly anyone remembers that Lawrie won at Carnoustie because the memories belong to Jean Van de Velde and his unseemly collapse. Lawrie's name only comes up in conversation as the last European to win a major.
While Woods did bounce back to break par in both weekend rounds, his iron play simply wasn't strong enough to give him a realistic chance at rallying. He often found himself far away from the cup on Carnoustie's tricky greens, leaving him more concerned with avoiding three putts than making one.
The Open will be played at Carnoustie, Scotland from July 19-22. Mardan Mamat was the first Singaporean to play at the Open, in 1997 and 2005.
Americans Woody Austin, Hunter Mahan and Pat Perez qualified for the British Open based on their results, although Austin said he will not go to Carnoustie.

"But he started tearing it up and I called our scout Mike Russell, who was there watching him, and I asked him how Maybin was playing."
How dominant did Maybin look at Erie? Mike Russell, a Detroit scout, reported that he had seen enough after one game to believe that Maybin could immediately help the Tigers. Dombrowski preached patience, but that lasted for five more games. Now the Tigers have a rookie who still wears braces trying to help them return to the World Series.
What happened is a mystery, unless you were scouting Willis along the way -- which is why Tigers scout Mike Russell made a steady sales pitch to Dombrowski and his staff to trade for Willis if the opportunity arose.

Abdul Hadi criticized such attacks as un-Islamic and un-Afghan during a speech Tuesday in the Archi district of Kunduz province, said Khair Mohammad Subat, the provincial education department director.
The driver detonated the explosives packed into the cabin of the small truck as police began to search the vehicle at a checkpost at the entrance of the northern town of Kunduz, provincial governor Mohammad Omar told AFP.
He was in Kandahar when the US bombing campaign began on October 10, 2001, and then moved north to Kunduz where he spent about two hours on the front lines outside the city before it collapsed, it said.
The five will leave Prague on Saturday and will be deployed in Kunduz and Fayzabad, police spokesman Roman Skrepek said in a statement. They will advise the border police, Skrepek said.

Muslim clerics in Balkh and Kunduz province arranged a demonstration in Mazar-i-Sharif last week against Kaambakhsh, calling on the government not to release him.
He was killed four days after three German soldiers died in a suicide blast in the northern province of Kunduz, which has also been relatively free of the insurgency-linked violence normally staged in the south and east.
The attack was in the northern province of Kunduz, where German troops serve with NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
Thain and Nishimuro met several times over the past few weeks, including at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and at a meeting of exchange leaders held in Paris. Both also spoke before the Japan Society in New York on Tuesday, but neither confirmed completion of a cooperation agreement.
The tone was a sharp departure from the somber mood that took hold of Davos a year ago, when Israeli and Palestinian delegates were stunned mid-conference by news of the Hamas victory in Palestinian elections.
This is not the first time Khalilzad has gotten into trouble for unauthorized contacts. In January, White House officials expressed anger about an unauthorized appearance in which Khalilzad sat beside the Iranian foreign minister at a panel of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, and a request from Khalilzad to be part of the U.S. delegation to Davos had been turned down by officials at the State Department and the White House, a senior administration official said.
Kocharian and Aliev last met in Davos, Switzerland, in January and have scheduled another round of talks in Vienna under the joint supervision of the United States, Russia and France.

The Chivas followed up in the 71st, when Adolfo Bautista won a ball in his half, dribbled up the field and passed to Alberto Medina, who slipped the ball into the goal.
Mexico then earned a throw-in in its end of the field. Alberto Medina touched the ball to Castillo, who ran from near the halfway line to the end line, rounding Oguchi Onyewu and finding Guardado, who roofed the shot at the back post in the 44th minute. This was the first Mexican goal against the US in nine games outside Mexico since 1999.
Mexico had a flurry of shots on goal early in the second half when midfielder Alberto Medina repeatedly worked it in from the right side.

Thousands of people are expected to jam Richmond's Capitol Square on Thursday for a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, when the British royals arrive to mark the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown colony, the first permanent English colony in the United States.
"There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond, Virginia.
David Sanchez Martinez sat in a cushioned chair nearby, hoping to become one of those bar codes. The pimply-faced 19-year-old borrowed $2,000 at a monthly interest rate of 30 percent from a loan shark in his hometown of Mazamitla Jalisco to finance his bus trip to Monterrey, buy food, pay the recruiter, pay the U.S. Consulate and -- if all goes well -- buy a Greyhound bus ticket to Richmond, where he'll push a lawnmower for hours each day.
It was the second straight week that NASCAR drivers had to linger an extra day. The race scheduled for May 5 in Richmond, Va., was moved to Sunday because of rain.

"That's what these people are willing to invest in," Epperson said.
The Shell refinery in Martinez stands to pay the most: for an estimated 4.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted (based on 2005 data) each year, the oil firm would owe just over $195,000. Others in the top 10 include the Chevron refinery in Richmond, a power plant in Pittsburg and a cement company in Cupertino.

"We need something to control the elk and buffalo," says Don O'Neil, of Butte, Mont., as he peers through his viewing scope.
HELENA, Montana -- The National Folk Festival comes to Montana this summer, bringing the event's mix of "music, dance and tradition from across America" to historic Butte. The festival will be centered in Uptown Butte, a picturesque area with a National Historic Landmark District that includes mansions, Victorian homes, boarding houses, miners' cottages and old 100- to 200-foot mining frames, which were used to bring workers in and out of the mines.

There was the young man in Butte, Mont., who put $1 down in order to take advantage of a layaway plan and purchase $10 worth of clothes, with a month to pay off his bill. And the father in Winnemucca, Nev.,  who bought oversized shoes for his boy, even though the dejected kid could hardly walk in them. "They'll last you two years instead of one," the father said encouragingly. "Don't worry, you'll grow into them."
Friends and family of the late Evel Knievel hurried to prepare the largest indoor venue in Butte, Montana, for a final goodbye to a hometown hero.
Which brings us to a sheep-shearing class here: 10 men and 5 women -- a few entrepreneurs, some back-to-the-land idealists, a psychiatrist from Butte who has made a bet with his wife, three high school buddies, a home builder looking for an economic sideline in tough times and a reporter trying to get inside the story.
Born in Butte, Mont., McCaig was lured to Manhattan, N.Y., as a young man. He worked for an advertising firm, including campaigns for Georg Jensen jewelry and After Six formalwear. Eventually, in the mid-1960s, McCaig decided he wanted to be a writer. He and his wife, Anne -- bitten by the back-to-the-land bug -- headed south in a pickup-truck camper.
But in a bowl that surveys indicated was the most anticipated outside the BCS Championship, Georgia reduced Hawaii to just another non-BCS tune-up. Hawaii strutted in as the nation's lone unbeaten team at 12-0 but with a schedule slightly more formidable than sand castles on Waikiki.
Particularly as Hawaii experiences a renewed wave of development (the median house price on Oahu is now about $650,000 and one of the largest development projects in Waikiki's history recently turned eight acres there into a mid-Pacific Beverly Hills), the emphasis on roots culture has intensified. It is not just that there are more incursions on renowned North Shore surf breaks; after all, as Hans Hedemann, a legendary pro surfer who operates surf schools on Oahu, said, "For good surfers, there's always plenty of waves." It is that the pressure has intensified on Hawaiians to define and claim their identity and what they think of as their space.
Our trip started and ended in Honolulu and included stops on Maui, Hawaii (the Big Island) and Kauai. We arrived two days early to spend time in Honolulu and Waikiki.
"If there's an entree the Thai government gives us to help them with the southern issue, we'll gladly take it," Fridovich said on the sidelines of a special operations conference in Waikiki, Hawaii.
In a state known for bustling, exciting tourist destinations such as Waikiki and the Kilauea volcano, Kalaupapa is sacred ground, with a history of disease, suffering and isolation.
Obama came from a modest background; suddenly his peers were the island's richest and most accomplished students. Around that time, America Online founder Steve Case, actress Kelly Preston and former Dallas Cowboys lineman Mark Tuinei attended the school, which offers kindergarten through 12th grade classes on a lush hillside campus overlooking the Waikiki skyline and Pacific Ocean.
The NFL is considering moving the Pro Bowl site. Next year is the final year the league has an agreement with the state of Hawaii. It will be the 30th and possibly final Pro Bowl at Aloha Stadium.

A yearlong pig hunt, including full-moon hunts with knives and dogs, will begin this weekend in areas along the Honolulu Mauka Trail System in the Koolau Mountains overlooking the growing Honolulu and Waikiki skyline.
"I served from a very young age at my parish in Waikiki. I was inspired by the religious priests and sisters, like a second family for me," said Passos. "I knew through interacting with them that that was what I wanted to do."
They sacrificed frolicking in the sunshine and the white sandy beaches of Waikiki, but in the end it was worth it for members of El Camino High School's Academic Decathlon team, who landed their fifth national title Saturday.
Lei-makers made camouflage nets instead of flower garlands. The U.S. military lined Waikiki beaches with barbed wire, giving the island the look of paradise under siege.
The Hawaii International Film Festival, the largest and one of the first to focus on Asian-Pacific films in the U.S., will be held mostly in Honolulu and Waikiki.
As many as 25,000 people are expected to attend a sunset beach memorial service at Waikiki for legendary Hawaiian crooner Don Ho.
"You have to take chances, musically, and you have to take them in your business," Bush said over the phone from Waikiki, Hawaii, fresh off an early-morning surfing lesson. "Everything we've done that was safe didn't work out."
But that is changing, and fast. Chinatown has become the nightlife destination of choice for Oahu's 20-something club- hoppers -- eclipsing Waikiki -- and some inviting dining establishments and wine bars have sprung up in response to demand. The art-gallery scene has taken firm root, too, and cultural attractions are enjoying a renaissance at the renovated Hawaii Theatre Center, a former silent-picture house.

"The management of the crisis has at times been a little chaotic, and the markets just don't accept that," said Axel Miller, Dexia's chief executive, who is leaving the bank. "It's time for regulators globally to get together to find some kind of global solution."
Chief executive Axel Miller said: "The financial crisis has created a new environment from which only banks with an optimal level of liquidity, asset quality and capital will be able to draw benefit.
Chief Executive Axel Miller said the quarter was marked by a "steep widening of market spreads and a deep deterioration of the U.S. mortgage credit environment."
Dexia chairman Pierre Richard and chief executive Axel Miller resigned on Tuesday, the company said after receiving a 6.4 billion euro state bailout.

Peres, of the ruling Kadima Party, received an unexpectedly high 58 votes in round one. Reuven Rivlin, a lawmaker and former parliament speaker from the hawkish Likud, took 37, and legislator Colette Avital of the Labor Party, 21.
Peres is expected to face off against former Knesset speaker Reuven Rivlin of the hawkish Likud, and Colette Avital of the centrist Labor Party. While Peres is the most high-profile candidate, victory is not assured.
"They suggested that there be officials (in the talks), and there wasn't any response from either side," lawmaker Colette Avital said.
The presidential race is slated for June 13. Peres is expected to square off against former Knesset spokesman Reuven Rivlin of the hawkish Likud, and Colette Avital of the dovish Labor party.
But even the Israeli left is worried. Colette Avital, a senior Labor Party member, was in Washington for briefings from Bush officials.
"The fact that he is going to be indicted is neither good for our reputation abroad nor for the morale of this country, and I hope that the sooner the president himself draws the conclusion, the sooner he decides to leave office, the better off we all will be," said Colette Avital, of the Labor Party, mentioned as a possible successor.
Israeli officials here also dismissed suggestions by the Israeli Consul General Colette Avital in New York that Hamas has groups operating out of Damascus. U.S. counterterrorism experts have not found evidence of this.

"It fits squarely with our announced strategy to grow our U.S. tobacco business beyond cigarettes and complements our recent initiatives in the smokeless category," Philip Morris USA chief executive Michael Szymanczyk said in a statement.

Then there is the danger of flying so far and so high. Bucky Lasek said he was dreading riding the ramp because he had little time to practice because of a nagging knee injury that was aggravated by riding it.
One retail consultant, Burt Flickinger III, praised Schultz's efforts but said the chain seems to have lost its relevance as a department store. "They have not found a format that can compete effectively against better capitalized and more capable competitors, whether it's Kohl's, J.C. Penney, J. Crew or Bed Bath &amp; Beyond on the apparel and linens side, or whether its Lowe's or Best Buy on the appliance side," he said.

Wu noted, however, that as many of Taiwan's most wanted economic criminals -- including Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hao -- have taken shelter in China, Taiwan people are prone to perceive China as a haven for Taiwanese economic fugitives.
Despite being held in high esteem as a man who always told the truth, Shen neither confirmed nor denied Chen Yu-hao's allegations.
